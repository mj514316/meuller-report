See Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27 .220. Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office\u0027s charging decisions, which contain three main components. First, the Office determined that Russia\u0027s two principal interference operations in the 2016 U.S. presidential election-the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers who carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and the have been so char ed. See United States v. Ne ksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215 D.D.C .. Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks\u0027s releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the professor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton .in the form of thousands of emails.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) II. RUSSIAN \"ACTIVE MEASURES\" SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The first form of Russian election influence came principally from the Internet Research Agency, LLC (IRA), a Russian organization funded by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and companies he controlled, including Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering (collectively \"Concord\").2 The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large U.S. audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system.3 These operations constituted \"active measures\" (aKTMBHbie Meporrprumu1), a term that typically refers to operations conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs.4 The IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as 2014. Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over time, these social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences. IRA employees travelled to the United States in mid-2014 on an intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and photographs for use in their social media posts. IRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political rallies.5 The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA\u0027s interference operation. By the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and 2 The Office is aware of reports that other Russian entities engaged in similar active measw-es operations targeting the United States. Some evidence collected by the Office corroborates those rep01ts, and the Office has shared that evidence with other offices in the Department of Justice and FBI. 3 Harm to Ongoing Matter see also SM-2230634, serial 44 (analysis). The FBI case number cited here, and other FBI case numbers identified in the report, should be treated as law enforcement sensitive given the context. The report contains additional law enforcement sensitive information. 4 As discussed in Part V below, the active measures investigation has resulted in criminal charges against 13 individual Russian nationals and three Russian entities, principally for conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) IV. RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS To AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN The Office identified multiple contacts-\"links,\" in the words of the Appointment between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether those contacts constituted a third avenue of attempted Russian interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election. In particular, the investigation examined whether these contacts involved or resulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the Trump Campaign and Russia, including with respect to Russia providing assistance to the Campaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future. Based on the available information, the investigation did not establish such coordination. This Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals with ties to the Russian government, including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates that have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts. Each subsection begins with an overview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are generally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and extending through the post-election, transition period. A. Campaign Period (September 2015 -November 8, 2016) Russian-government-connected individuals and media entities began showing interest in Trump\u0027s campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015.288 Because Trump\u0027s status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and entertainment dealings, this Office investigated whether a business contact with Russia-linked individuals and entities during the campaign period-the Trump Tower Moscow project, see Volume l, Section IV.A. I, infra-led to or involved coordination of election assistance. Outreach from individuals with ties to Russia continued in the spring and \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_216", "label": "par_216", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e obvious that he wants to earn lots of money.\"529 Podobnyy said that he had led Page on by \"feed[ing] him empty promises\" that Podobnyy would use his Russian business connections to help Page.530 Podobnyy told the other intelligence officer that his method of recruiting foreign sources was to promise them favors and then discard them once he obtained relevant information from them.531 In 2015, Podobnyy and two other Russian intelligence officers were charged with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign government.532 The criminal complaint detailed Podobnyy\u0027s interactions with and conversations about Page, who was identified only as \"Male-1.\"533 Based on the criminal complaint\u0027s description of the interactions, Page was aware that he was the individual described as \"Male-l.\"534 Page later spoke with a Russian government \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_273", "label": "par_273", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e attend.837 The investigation did not identify evidence that the two men met at any point after their September 8 meeting. 8. Paul Manafort Paul Manafort served on the Trump Campaign, including a period as campaign chairman, from March to August 2016.838 Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. Manafort stayed in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort\u0027s office in Kiev and who the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence. Manafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign and a longtime employee, 839 to provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign-including internal polling data, although Manafort claims not to recall that specific instruction. Manafort expected Kilimnik to share that information with others in Ukraine and with Deripaska. Gates periodically sent such polling data to Kilimnik during the campaign. 834 Luff 1/30/18 302, at 6; Landrum 2/27/18 302, at 4-5. 835 Sessions 1/17 /l 8 302, at 23. 836 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. 837 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. 838 On August 21, 2018, Manafo1t was convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia on eight tax, Foreign Bank Account Registration (FBAR), and bank fraud charges. On September 14, 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States (money laundering, tax fraud, FBAR, Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), and FARA false statements), and (2) conspiracy to obstruct justice (witness tampering).

The conduct at issue in both cases involved Manafort\u0027s work in Ukraine and the money he earned for that work, as well as crimes after the Ukraine work ended. On March 7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months of imprisonment in the Virginia prosecution. On March 13, the district court in D.C. sentenced Manafo1t to a total term of 73 months: 60 months on the Count 1 conspiracy (with 30 of those months to run concurrent to the Virginia sentence), and 13 months on the Count 1 conspiracy, to be served consecutive to the other two sentences. The two sentences resulted in a total term of 90 months. 839 As noted in Volume I, Section III.D. l .b, supra, Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the District of Columbia, including making a false statement to the FBI, pursuant to a plea agreement. He has provided information and in-court testimony that the Office has deemed to be reliable. See also Transcript at 16, United States v. Paul J Manafort, Jr., l:17-cr-201 (D.D.C.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) V. PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel\u0027s Office \"to prosecute federal crimes arising from [its] investigation\" of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to exercise this prosecutorial authority, the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney\u0027s) Manual. In particular, the Office has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for prosecution constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction for such an offense. Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those questions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction, and there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution. Id. As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of Russian nationals for their roles in er etratin the active-measures social media cam ai n and similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of campaign-finance offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction. At the same time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging certain individuals connected to the Campaign with making false statements or otherwise obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations. A. Russian \"Active Measures\" Social Media Campaign On February 16, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment charging 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities-including the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Concord Management and Consulting LLC (Concord)-with violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes.1276 The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One), three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and \u0141bank fraud (Count Two), and five defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight). Internet Research Agency Indictment. Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One conspiracy, entered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to dismiss the charge on multiple grounds. In orders and memorandum opinions issued on August 13 and November 15, 2018, the district court denied Concord\u0027s motions to dismiss. United States v. Concord Management \u0026 Consulting LLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_357", "label": "par_357", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterfl:ey Werk Preettet // Moy Cefltoifl Material Preteetee Ufl:eef Pee. R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) Although members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S. person with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was speaking with Russian nationals engaged in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore determined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge them in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging a wire-and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Russian nationals (Count Two). The Office did, however, charge one U.S. national for his role in supplying false or stolen bank account numbers that allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems by circumventing those systems\u0027 security features. On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty, pursuant to a single-count information, to identity fraud, in violation of 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) and (b)(l)(D). Plea Agreement, United States v. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2018), Doc. 10. The investigation did not establish that Pinedo was aware of the identity of the IRA members who purchased bank account numbers from him. Pinedo\u0027s sales of account numbers enabled the IRA members to anonymously access a financial network through which they transacted with U.S. persons and companies. See Gov\u0027t Sent. Mem. at 3, United States v. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 (D.D.C. Sept. 26, 2018), Doc. 24. On October 10, 2018, Pinedo was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be followed by six months of home confinement, and was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service. B. Russian Hacking and Dumping Operations 1. Section 1030 Computer-Intrusion Conspiracy a. Background On July 13, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment charging Russian military intelligence officers from the GRU with conspiring to hack into various U.S. computers used by the Clinton Campaign, DNC, DCCC, and other U.S. persons, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030 and 371 (Count One); committing identity theft and conspiring to commit money laundering in furtherance of that hacking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 I 028A and l 956(h) (Counts Two through Ten); and a separate conspiracy to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities responsible for the administration of the 2016 U.S. election, in violation of18U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030and371 (CountEleven). Netyksholndictment.1277 Asofthiswriting,all 12 defendants remain at large. The Netyksho indictment alleges that the defendants conspired with one another and with others to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere in the election.

R:. Criffl. P. 6(e) C. Russian Government Outreach and Contacts As explained in Section IV above, the Office\u0027s investigation uncovered evidence of numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above-with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine. One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on Hillary Clinton-implicates an additional body of law: campaignfinance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As ex lained below, the Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russiaaffiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct the Office\u0027s investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice. 1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of \"collusion,\" but through the lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[ e ]\" appears in the Acting Attorney General\u0027s August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown \u0026 Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. See Black\u0027s Law Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is \"[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law\"); 1 Alexander Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) (\"An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.\"); 1 Bouvier\u0027s Law Dictionary 352 180 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 13}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_365", "label": "par_365", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice A:t:1:erttey Werk Predttet // Mtt;s CetttttiH Mttterittl Preteeted Uttder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) (1897) (\"An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.\"). For that reason, this Office\u0027s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term \"collusion.\" The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy-either under statutes that have their own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1349, 195l(a)), or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law-including foreign-fnfluence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either under a specific statute or under Section 371 \u0027s offenses clause. The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under Section 371 \u0027s defraud clause.

Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation will require some \"proof of the defendant\u0027s knowledge of the law\"); United States v. Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d 573, 577 (E.D. Va. 2013) (applying willfulness standard drawn from Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 191-92 (1998)); see also Wagner v. FEC, 793 F.3d 1, 19 n.23 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (en bane) (same). A \"knowing[] and willful[]\" violation involving an aggregate of $2,000 or more in a calendar year, but less than $25,000, is a misdemeanor. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(l)(A)(ii). b. Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting The Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in connection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office concluded that, in light of the government\u0027s substantial burden of proof on issues of intent (\"knowing\" and \"willful\"), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that \"the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.\" Justice Manual\u00a7 9-27.220. In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an \"offer\" from Russia\u0027s \"Crown prosecutor\" to \"the Trump campaign\" of \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.\u0027s] father.\" The email described this as \"very high level and sensitive information\" that is \"part of Russia and its government\u0027s support to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin.\" Trump Jr. responded: \"if it\u0027s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\" Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up conversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was attended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that could assist candidate Trump\u0027s electoral prospects. This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012 l(a)(l )(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide \"official documents and information\" to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the presidential election. Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those materials. Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner and Mana fort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources. The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the foreign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; the solicitation of an illegal foreignsource contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of \"an express or implied promise to make a 185 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 21}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_383", "label": "par_383", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Prod1:1et // Ma,\u00b7 Cmnain Material Proteeted Under Fed. R. Criffi. P. 6(e) did not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law. Given his less direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has not developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues. iii. Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information The Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(l). The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions-such as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost or the cost of distribution-would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting. Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that the information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy may well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, see, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485,489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone\u0027s description of the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the information\u0027s value-i.e., that it would \"incriminate Hillary\" and \"would be very useful to [Trump Jr.\u0027s] father\"-was specific and may have been understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given Goldstone\u0027s lack of direct access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be delivered could be reflected in Trump Jr.\u0027s response (\"if it\u0027s what you say I love it\") (emphasis added). Accordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting. c. Application to Harm to Ongoing Matter Harm to Ongoing Matter 188 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_577", "label": "par_577", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterfl:e~\u00b7 Werk Preattet // May CeRtaifl: Material Pl\u0027eteeteEi Ufl:Eier Fee. R. Crim. P. 6(ej cited Corney\u0027s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired Corney for that reason. But the facts surrounding Corney\u0027s handling of the Clinton email investigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the President had made it clear to both Corney and the President\u0027s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted Corney to stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Corney\u0027s handling of the Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Corney. The President\u0027s draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the press after Corney\u0027s termination that the White House had heard from \"countless\" FBI agents who had lost confidence in Corney. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told Corney at their January 27 dinner that \"the people of the FBI really like [him],\" no evidence suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Corney, and Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything. We also considered why it was important to the President that Corney announce publicly that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Corney that the \"cloud\" of \"this Russia business\" was making it difficult to run the country. The President told Sessions and McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that the perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues. The President complained to Rogers that \"the thing with the Russians [ was] messing up\" his ability to get things done with Russia, and told Coats, \"I can\u0027t do anything with Russia, there\u0027s things I\u0027d like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they\u0027re all over me with this.\" The President also may have viewed Corney as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that the President was not under investigation. Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI\u0027s interview of Flynn, the President had a one-on-one dinner with Corney, against the advice of senior aides, and told Corney he needed Corney\u0027s \"loyalty.\" When the President later asked Corney for a second time to make public that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying \"Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.\" After the President learned of Sessions\u0027s recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney General \"who to investigate.\" In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation behind him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Corney was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) earlier provision is instructive. Recognizing that \"the proper administration of justice may be impeded or thwarted\" by a \"variety of corrupt methods ... limited only by the imagination of the criminally inclined,\" S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (1982), Congress considered a bill that would have amended Section 1512 by making it a crime, inter alia, when a person \"corruptly ... influences, obstructs, or impedes ... [t]he enforcement and prosecution of federal law,\" \"administration of a law under which an official proceeding is being or may be conducted,\" or the \"exercise of a Federal legislative power of inquiry.\" Id. at 17-19 ( quoting S. 2420). The Senate Committee explained that: [T]he purpose of preventing an obstruction of or miscarriage of justice cannot be fully carried out by a simple enumeration of the commonly prosecuted obstruction offenses. There must also be protection against the rare type of conduct that is the product of the inventive criminal mind and which also thwarts justice. Id. at 18. The report gave examples of conduct \"actually prosecuted under the current residual clause [in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503], which would probably not be covered in this series [of provisions] without a residual clause.\" Id. One prominent example was \"[a] conspiracy to cover up the Watergate burglary and its aftermath by having the Central Intelligence Agency seek to interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation of the burglary.\" Id. (citing United States v. Haldeman, 559 F.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976)). The report therefore indicates a congressional awareness not only that residual-clause language resembling Section 1512( c )(2) broadly covers a wide variety of obstructive conduct, but also that such language reaches the improper use of governmental processes to obstruct justice-specifically, the Watergate cover-up orchestrated by White House officials including the President himself. See Haldeman, 559 F .3d at 51, 86-87, 120-129, 162.1081 4. General Principles of Statutory Construction Do Not Suggest That Section 1512(c)(2) is Inapplicable to the Conduct in this Investigation The requirement of fair warning in criminal law, the interest in avoiding due process concerns in potentially vague statutes, and the rule of lenity do not justify narrowing the reach of Section 1512( c )(2)\u0027 s text. 1082 a. As with other criminal laws, the Supreme Court has \"exercised restraint\" in interpreting obstruction-of-justice provisions, both out ofrespect for Congress\u0027s role in defining crimes and in the interest of providing individuals with \"fair warning\" of what a criminal statute prohibits. Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018); Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 703; 1081 The Senate ultimately accepted the House version of the bill, which excluded an omnibus clause. See United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369, 382-383 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (tracing history of the proposed omnibus provision in the witness-protection legislation). During the floor debate on the bill, Senator Heinz, one of the initiators and primary backers of the legislation, explained that the omnibus clause was beyond the scope of the witness-protection measure at issue and likely \"duplicative\" of other obstruction laws, 128 Cong. Rec. 26,810 (1982) (Sen. Heinz), presumably referring to Sections 1503 and 1505. 1082 In a separate section addressing considerations unique to the presidency, we consider principles of statutory construction relevant in that context.
