Gordon stated that he connected with both of them (he could not recall if by phone or in person) and apprised them of the language he took issue with in the proposed amendment. Gordon recalled no objection by either Dearborn or Mashburn and that all three Campaign advisors supported the alternative formulation (\"appropriate assistance\").809 Dearborn recalled Gordon warning them about the amendment, but not weighing in because Gordon was more familiar with the Campaign\u0027s foreign policy stance.810 Mashburn stated that Gordon reached him, and he told Gordon that Trump had not taken a stance on the issue and that the Campaign should not intervene.811 When the amendment came up again in the committee\u0027s proceedings, the subcommittee changed the amendment by striking the \"lethal defense weapons\" language and replacing it with 801 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 3. 802 M.

Putin).\"1264 Shortly thereafter, Flynn sent a text message to McFarland summarizing his call with Kislyak from the day before, which she emailed to Kushner, Bannon, Priebus, and other Transition Team members.1265 The text message and email did not include sanctions as one of the topics discussed with Kislyak.1266 Flynn told the Office that he did not document his discussion of sanctions because it could be perceived as getting in the way of the Obama Administration\u0027s foreign policy.1267 On December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at the highest levels and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate to the sanctions in response to the request.1268 Two hours later, Flynn spoke with McFarland and relayed his conversation with Kislyak.1269 According to McFarland, Flynn remarked that the Russians wanted a better relationship and that the relationship was back on track. 127\u00b0 Flynn also told McFarland that he believed his phone call had made a difference.1271 McFarland recalled congratulating Flynn in response.1272 Flynn spoke with other Transition Team members that day, but does not recall whether they discussed the sanctions.1273 Flynn recalled discussing the sanctions with Bannon the next day and that Bannon appeared to know about Flynn\u0027s conversation with Kislyak.1274 Bannon, 1262 Comment by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on recent US sanctions and the expulsion of Russian diplomats, Moscow, December 20, 2016, The Ministry ofForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation (Dec. 30, 2016 (5:32 a.m.)). 1263 Statement of the President of the Russian Federation, Kremlin, Office of the President (Dec. 30, 2016 (7:15 a.m.)). 1264 @realDonaldTrump 12/30/16 (11:41 a.m.) Tweet. 1265 12/30/16 Email, Flynn to McFarland; 12/30/16 Email, McFarland to Kushner et al. 1266 12/30/16 Email, McFarland to Kushner et al. 1267 Flynn 11/17/17 302, at 4. 1268 Call Records of Michael T.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) Second, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to representatives of Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that he only asked the countries\u0027 positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That statement was false. On December 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the incoming Trump Administration\u0027s opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn also falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia\u0027s response to his December 22 request regarding the resolution. Kislyak in fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that Russia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote. See Flynn Statement of Offense ,r 4. Flynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as National Security Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Flynn\u0027s false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on that ongoing investigation. Flynn Statement of Offense ,r,r 1-2. They also came shortly before Flynn made separate submissions to the Depa1tment of Justice, pursuant to FARA, that also contained materially false statements and omissions. Id. ,r 5. Based on the totality of that conduct, the Office decided to charge Flynn with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 l00l(a). On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that charge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing. See id.; Plea Agreement, United States v. Michael T Flynn, No. l:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 3. Flynn is awaiting sentencing. iv.

From the fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen was involved in a project to build a Trump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow. The project was known as Trump Tower Moscow. In 2017, Cohen was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between Russia and the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen caused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow. Cohen Information ,r,r 2-3. The letter contained three representations relevant here. First, Cohen stated that the Trump Moscow project had ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate Trump on the project only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it. Second, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project and never considered asking Trump to travel for the project. Third, Cohen stated that he did not recall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that 195 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 15}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_461", "label": "par_461", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e about the calls in the first week after the inauguration, and Flynn told similar lies to the FBI. On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House that Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBT. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Corney in which he asked for Corney\u0027s loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Corney in which he said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\" Evidence 1. Incoming National Security Advisor Flynn Discusses Sanctions on Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak Shortly after the election, President-Elect Trump announced he would appoint Michael Flynn as his National Security Advisor.78 For the next two months, Flynn played an active role on the Presidential Transition Team (PTT) coordinating policy positions and communicating with foreign government officials, including Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.79 On December 29, 2016, as noted in Volume II, Section TT.A.4, supra, the Obama Administration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian individuals and entities.80 That day, multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the sanctions and the impact they would have on the incoming Administration, and Flynn informed members of the PTT that he would be speaking to the Russian Ambassador later in the day.81 78 Flynn 11/16/17 302, at 7; President-Elect Donald.I Trump Selects US.

Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a \"trusted person\" who could offer the Campaign \"political synergy\" and \"synergy on a government level,\" Klokov recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary. Klokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the candidate and an individual Klokov described as \"our person of interest.\"337 In an email to the Office, Erchova later identified the \"person of interest\" as Russian President Vladimir Putin. 338 In the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local developers. Cohen registered his willingness also to meet with Klokov and the unidentified intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate including a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin-would need to be \"in conjunction with the development and an official visit\" with the Trump Organization receiving a formal invitation to visit.339 (Klokov had written previously that \"the visit [by candidate Trump to Russia] has to be informal.\")340 Klokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over a possible meeting between Trump and \"the person of interest\" from any existing business track. 341 Re-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second email to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have \"phenomenal\" impact \"in a business dimension\" and that the \"person of interest[\u0027s]\" \"most important support\" could have significant ramifications for the \"level of projects and their capacity.\" Klokov concluded by telling 335 11/16/15 Email, I.

Writing from her personal email account, Poliakova stated that she had been trying to reach Cohen and asked that he call her on the personal number that she provided.350 Shortly after receiving Poliakova\u0027s email, Cohen called and spoke to her for 20 minutes.351 Cohen described to Poliakova his position at the Trump Organization and outlined the proposed Trump Moscow project, including information about the Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization had partnered. Cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to build the project and with financing. According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed questions and took notes, stating that she would need to follow up with others in Russia.352 Cohen could not recall any direct follow-up from Poliakova or from any other representative of the Russian government, nor did the Office identify any evidence of direct follow-up.

R. Criffl. P. e(e) to Cohen, he elected not to travel at the time because of concerns about the lack of concrete proposals about land plots that could be considered as options for the project.357 d. Discussions about Russia Travel by Michael Cohen or Candidate Trump (December 2015-June 2016) i. Sater \u0027s Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia The late January communication was neither the first nor the last time that Cohen contemplated visiting Russia in pursuit of the Trump Moscow project. Beginning in late 2015, Sater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump Organization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing partners. In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for traveling to Russia for meetings.358 On December 19, 2015, Sater wrote: Please call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line. [359] He needs a copy of your and Donald\u0027s passports they need a scan of every page of the passports. Invitations \u0026 Visas will be issued this week by VTB Bank to discuss financing for Trump Tower Moscow. Politically neither Putins office nor Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot issue invite, so they are inviting commercially/ business. VTB is Russia\u0027s 2 biggest bank and VTB Bank CEO Andrey Kostin, will be at all meetings with Putin so that it is a business meeting not political. We will be invited to Russian consulate this week to receive invite \u0026 have visa issued.360 In response, Cohen texted Sater an image of his own passport.361 Cohen told the Office that at one point he requested a copy of candidate Trump\u0027s passport from Rhona Graff, Trump\u0027s executive assistant at the Trump Organization, and that Graff later brought Trump\u0027s passport to Cohen\u0027s 357 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 6-7. 358 See, e.g., 12/1/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12:41 p.m.) (\"Please scan and send me a copy of your passport for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"). 359 Toll records show that Sater was speaking to Evgeny Dvoskin. Call Records of Felix Sater Dvoskin is an executive of Genbank, a large bank with lending focused in Crimea, Ukraine. At the time that Sater provided this financing letter to Cohen, Genbank was subject to U.S. government sanctions, see Russia/Ukraine-related Sanctions and Identifications, Office of Foreign Assets Control (Dec. 22, 2015), available at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAEnforcement/Pages/20151222.aspx. Dvoskin, who had been deported from the United States in 2000 for criminal activity, was under indictment in the United States for stock fraud under the aliases Eugene Slusker and Gene Shustar.

According to written answers from President Trump,380 Graff received an email from Deputy Prime Minister Prikhodko on March 17, 2016, again inviting Trump to participate in the 2016 Forum in St. Petersburg.381 Two weeks later, on March 31, 2016, Graff prepared for Trump\u0027s signature a two-paragraph letter declining the invitation.382 The letter stated that Trump\u0027s \"schedule has become extremely demanding\" because of the presidential campaign, that he \"already ha[ d] several commitments in the United States\" for the time of the Forum, but that he otherwise \"would have gladly given every consideration to attending such an important event.\"383 Graff forwarded the letter to another executive assistant at the Trump Organization with instructions to print the document on letterhead for Trump to sign.384 At approximately the same time that the letter was being prepared, Robert Foresman-a New York-based investment banker-began reaching out to Graff to secure an in-person meeting with candidate Trump. According to Foresman, he had been asked by Anton Kobyakov, a Russian presidential aide involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speak at the Forum.385 Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction brokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the television show The Apprentice). In his email, Foresman referenced his long-standing personal and professional expertise in Russia and Ukraine, his work setting up an early \"private channel\" between Vladimir Putin and former U.S. President George W.

Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate, Corey Lewandowski, or \"another relevant person\" to discuss this and other \"concrete things\" Foresman felt uncomfortable discussing over \"unsecure email.\"386 On April 4, 2016, Graff forwarded Foresman\u0027s meeting request to Jessica Macchia, another executive assistant to Trump.387 379 1/15/16 Email, Mira to Graff. 380 As explained in Volume II and Appendix C, on September 17, 2018, the Office sent written questions to the President\u0027s counsel.

The President Asse11s that the Special Counsel has Conflicts of Interest In the days following the Special Counsel\u0027s appointment, the President repeatedly told advisors, including Priebus, Bannon, and McGahn, that Special Counsel Mueller had conflicts of interest.528 The President cited as conflicts that Mueller had interviewed for the FBI Director position sho11ly before being appointed as Special Counsel, that he had worked for a law firm that represented people affiliated with the President, and that Mueller had disputed certain fees relating to his membership in a Trump golf course in Northern Virginia.529 The President\u0027s advisors pushed 522 Hunt-000050 (Hunt 5/18/17 Notes); Priebus 10/13/17 302, at 21; Hunt 2/1/18 302, at 21. 523 Hunt-000051 (Hunt 5/18/17 Notes). 524 SCR026_000110 (President\u0027s Daily Diary, 5/19/17). 525 Hicks 12/8/ 17 3 02, at 22. 526 Priebus 10/13/17 302, at 21.

For example, in August 2016, foreign policy advisor J.D. Gordon declined an invitation to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak\u0027s residence because the timing was \"not optimal\" in view of media reports about Russian interference.46 On August 19, 2016, Manafort was asked to resign amid media coverage scrutinizing his ties to a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and links to Russian business.47 And when the media published stories about Page\u0027s connections to Russia in September 2016, Trump Campaign officials terminated Page\u0027s association with the Campaign and told the press that he had played \"no role\" in the Campaign.48 On October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks released the first set of emails stolen by a Russian intelligence agency from Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta.49 The same day, the federal government announced that \"the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\"50 The government statement directly linked Russian hacking to the releases on WikiLeaks, with the goal of interfering with the presidential election, and concluded \"that only Russia\u0027s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities\" based on their \"scope and sensitivity.\"51 On October 11, 2016, Podesta stated publicly that the FBI was investigating Russia\u0027s hacking and said that candidate Trump might have known in advance that the hacked emails were going to be released.52 Vice Presidential Candidate Mike Pence was asked whether the Trump 45 Cohen 11/20/18 302, at I; Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 3-5.

We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the June 9 meeting. On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give \"a major speech\" \"probably Monday of next week\"-which would have been June 13-about \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.\" See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, Washington Post (Aug. 7, 2018). Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changed the subject of his planned speech to national security. But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was connected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that meeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton. Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, could well have caused the change. The President\u0027s written answers to our questions state that the speech\u0027s focus was altered \u0027\u0027[i]n light of\u0027 the Pulse nightclub shooting. See Written Responses, supra. As for the original topic of the June 13 speech, Trump has said that \"he expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative inf01mation about the Clintons,\" and that the draft of the speech prepared by Campaign staff\"was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.\" Written Responses, supra. In a later June 22 speech, Trump did speak extensively about allegations that Clinton was corrupt, drawing from the Clinton Cash book.

Jared Kushner\u0027s-Continuing Contacts with Simes Between the April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel and the presidential election, Jared Kushner had periodic contacts with Simes.648 Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings and phone conversations, which concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the Campaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes had proposed.649 Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia, and that Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians.650 According to Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of Russian contacts with Kushner, advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts, and told Kushner both that the Campaign should not highlight Russia as an issue and should handle any contacts with Russians with care.651 Kushner generally provided a similar account of his interactions with Simes.652 Among the Kushner-Simes meetings was one held on August 17, 2016, at Simes\u0027 s request, in Kushner\u0027s New York office.

A \"knowing[] and willful[]\" violation involving an aggregate of $2,000 or more in a calendar year, but less than $25,000, is a misdemeanor. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(l)(A)(ii). b. Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting The Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in connection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office concluded that, in light of the government\u0027s substantial burden of proof on issues of intent (\"knowing\" and \"willful\"), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that \"the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.\" Justice Manual\u00a7 9-27.220. In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an \"offer\" from Russia\u0027s \"Crown prosecutor\" to \"the Trump campaign\" of \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.\u0027s] father.\" The email described this as \"very high level and sensitive information\" that is \"part of Russia and its government\u0027s support to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin.\" Trump Jr. responded: \"if it\u0027s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\" Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up conversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was attended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that could assist candidate Trump\u0027s electoral prospects. This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012 l(a)(l )(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide \"official documents and information\" to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the presidential election. Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those materials. Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner and Mana fort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources.

Please share with them -we believe this is a good foundation to start from.\"1117 Gerson informed Dmitriev that he had given the document to Kushner soon after delivering it.1118 On January 26, 2017, Dmitriev wrote to Gerson that his \"boss\"-an apparent reference to Putin-was asking if there had been any feedback on the proposal.1119 Dmitriev said, \"[w]e do not want to rush things and move at a comfortable speed. At the same time, my boss asked me to try to have the key US meetings in the next two weeks if possible.\"1120 He informed Gerson that Putin and President Trump would speak by phone that Saturday, and noted that that information was \"very confidential.\"1121 The same day, Dmitriev wrote to Nader that he had seen his \"boss\" again yesterday who had \"emphasized that this is a great priority for us and that we need to build this communication 1109 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 4. 1110 1 /18/17 Text Messages, Dmitriev \u0026 Gerson. 1111 1/16/17 Text Messages; Dmitriev \u0026 Gerson. 1112 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3; Gerson 6/15/18 302, at 2. 1113 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3. 1114 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3; Gerson 6/15/18.302, at 1-2; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 22. 1115 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3. 1116 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 32. 1117 1/19/17 Text Message, Dmitriev to Nader (11: 11 :56 a.m.). 1118 1/18/17 Text Message, Gerson to Dmitriev; Gerson 6/15/18 302, at 2. 1119 1/26/17 Text Message, Dmitriev to Gerson. 1120 1/26/17 Text Message, Dmitriev to Gerson. 1121 1/26/17 Text Message, Dmitriev to Gerson. 158 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 16}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_562", "label": "par_562", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AH6rttey W6rk Pr6clttet // May C6tttaiH Material Pr6teetecl Uflcler Fecl.

Trump informed FBI Director James Corney that he has been terminated and removed from office. President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\"449 That evening, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was summoned to meet with the President at the White House.450 The President told McCabe that he had fired Corney because of the decisions Corney had made in the Clinton email investigation and for many other reasons.451 The President asked McCabe if he was aware that Corney had told the President three times that he was not under investigation.452 The President also asked McCabe whether many people in the FBI disliked Corney and whether McCabe was part of the \"resistance\" that had disagreed with Corney\u0027s decisions in the Clinton investigation.453 McCabe told the President that he knew Corney had told the President he was not under investigation, that most people in the FBI felt positively about Corney, and that McCabe worked \"very closely\" with Corney and was part of all the decisions that had been made in the Clinton investigation.454 445 Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 10; Eisenberg 11/29/17 302, at 15 (providing the view that the President\u0027s desire to include the language about not being under investigation was the \"driving animus of the whole thing\"); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 16 (Burnham knew the only line the President cared about was the line that said Corney advised the President on three separate occasions that the President was not under investigation). According to Hunt\u0027s notes, the reference to Corney\u0027s statement would indicate that \"notwithstanding\" Corney\u0027s having informed the President that he was not under investigation, the President was terminating Corney.
