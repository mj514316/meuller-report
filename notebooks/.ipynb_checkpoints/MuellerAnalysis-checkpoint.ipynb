P. 6(e) Second, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to representatives of Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that he only asked the countries\\' positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That statement was false. On December 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the incoming Trump Administration\\'s opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn also falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia\\'s response to his December 22 request regarding the resolution. Kislyak in fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that Russia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote. See Flynn Statement of Offense ,r 4. Flynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as National Security Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Flynn\\'s false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on that ongoing investigation. Flynn Statement of Offense ,r,r 1-2. They also came shortly before Flynn made separate submissions to the Depa1tment of Justice, pursuant to FARA, that also contained materially false statements and omissions. Id. ,r 5. Based on the totality of that conduct, the Office decided to charge Flynn with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U .S.C. § l00l(a). On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that charge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing. See id.; Plea Agreement, United States v. Michael T Flynn, No. l:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 3. Flynn is awaiting sentencing. iv. Michael Cohen Michael Cohen was the executive vice president and special counsel to the Trump Organization when Trump was president of the Trump Organization. Information ,r 1, United States v. Cohen, No. 1 :18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2018), Doc. 2 (\"Cohen Information\"). From the fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen was involved in a project to build a Trump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow. The project was known as Trump Tower Moscow. In 2017, Cohen was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between Russia and the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen caused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow. Cohen Information ,r,r 2-3. The letter contained three representations relevant here. First, Cohen stated that the Trump Moscow project had ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate Trump on the project only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it. Second, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project and never considered asking Trump to travel for the project. Third, Cohen stated that he did not recall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that 195 '"

On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House that Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBT. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Corney in which he asked for Corney's loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Corney in which he said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\" Evidence 1. Incoming National Security Advisor Flynn Discusses Sanctions on Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak Shortly after the election, President-Elect Trump announced he would appoint Michael Flynn as his National Security Advisor.78 For the next two months, Flynn played an active role on the Presidential Transition Team (PTT) coordinating policy positions and communicating with foreign government officials, including Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.79 On December 29, 2016, as noted in Volume II, Section TT.A.4, supra, the Obama Administration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian individuals and entities.80 That day, multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the sanctions and the impact they would have on the incoming Administration, and Flynn informed members of the PTT that he would be speaking to the Russian Ambassador later in the day.81 78 Flynn 11/16/17 302, at 7; President-Elect Donald.I Trump Selects US.

FBI Director Corney Publicly Confirms the Existence of the Russia Investigation in Testimony Before HPSCI On March 9, 2017, Corney briefed the \"Gang of Eight\" congressional leaders about the FBI's investigation of Russian interference, including an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation.307 Although it is unclear whether the President knew of that briefing at the time, notes taken by Annie Donaldson, then McGahn' s chief of staff, on March 12, 2017, state, \"POTUS in panic/chaos ... Need binders to put in front of POTUS. (1) All things related to Russia.\"308 The week after Corney's briefing, the White House Counsel's Office was in contact with SSCI Chairman Senator Richard Burr about the Russia investigations and appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation.309 On March 20, 2017, Corney was scheduled to testify before HPSCI.310 In advance of Corney's testimony, congressional officials made clear that they wanted Corney to provide information about the ongoing FBI investigation.311 Dana Boente, who at that time was the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, authorized Corney to confirm the existence of the Russia investigation and agreed that Corney should decline to comment on whether any particular individuals, including the President, were being investigated.312 306 Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 14; see SC_ AD_ 000168 (Donaldson 3/6/17 Notes) (\"POTUS wants to call Dana [then the Acting Attorney General for campaign-related investigations]/ Is investigation I No/ We know something on Flynn/ GSA got contacted by FBI/ There's something hot\"). 307 Corney 11/15/17 302, at 13-14; SNS-Classified-0000140-44 (3/8/17 Email, Gauhar to Page et al.). 308 SC_AD _00188 (Donaldson 3/12/18 Notes).

The \"targets\" were identified in notes taken by Donaldson as \"Flynn (FBI was ~ooking for phone records\"; \"Comey~Manafort (Ukr + Russia, not campaign)\";~ \"Carter Page ($ game)\"; and \"Greek Guy\" (potentially referring to George Papadopoulos, later charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 for lying to the FBI).

Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered by his Recusal Later in 2017, the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who would not be recused. On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the Department of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the Department should be investigating.752 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who was at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton's emails and said, \"Don't have to tell us, just take [a] look.\"753 Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the Department of Justice would comply with that request. 754 Two days later, on October 18, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Wow, FBI confirms report that James Corney drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Corney stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?\"755 On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was \"ANGER &amp; UNITY\" over a \"lack of investigation\" of Clinton arid \"the Corney fix,\" and concluded: \"DO SOMETHTNG!\"756 On December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end of a cabinet meeting.757 During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President again suggested that Sessions could \"unrecuse,\" which Porter linked to taking back supervision of the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton.758 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said, \"T don't know if you could un-recuse yourself. You'd be a hero. Not telling you to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get involved. Can order AG to investigate. I don't want to get involved. I'm not going to get involved.

While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\"773 The next day, the President tweeted a response: '\"Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.'

Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!\"774 On November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, the President replaced Sessions with Sessions's chief of staff as Acting Attorney General.775 Analysis In analyzing the President's efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control of the Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidence are relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. To determine if the President's effo11s to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General's recusal covered (\"Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!\"). 769 @realDonaldTrump 6/5/18 (7:31 a.m. ET) Tweet. 770 @realDonaldTrump 8/1 /18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet. 771 Fox &amp; Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 772 Fox &amp; Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 773 Sessions 8/23/18 Press Statement. 774 @real Donald Trump 8/24/18 (6: 17 a.m. ET) Tweet;@ realDonaldTrump 8/24/18 (6:28 a.m. ET) Tweet. 775 @realDonaldTrump 11/7/18 (2:44 p.m. ET) Tweet.

On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House that Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBT. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Corney in which he asked for Corney's loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Corney in which he said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\" Evidence 1. Incoming National Security Advisor Flynn Discusses Sanctions on Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak Shortly after the election, President-Elect Trump announced he would appoint Michael Flynn as his National Security Advisor.78 For the next two months, Flynn played an active role on the Presidential Transition Team (PTT) coordinating policy positions and communicating with foreign government officials, including Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.79 On December 29, 2016, as noted in Volume II, Section TT.A.4, supra, the Obama Administration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian individuals and entities.80 That day, multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the sanctions and the impact they would have on the incoming Administration, and Flynn informed members of the PTT that he would be speaking to the Russian Ambassador later in the day.81 78 Flynn 11/16/17 302, at 7; President-Elect Donald.I Trump Selects US.

Need binders to put in front of POTUS. (1) All things related to Russia.\"308 The week after Corney's briefing, the White House Counsel's Office was in contact with SSCI Chairman Senator Richard Burr about the Russia investigations and appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation.309 On March 20, 2017, Corney was scheduled to testify before HPSCI.310 In advance of Corney's testimony, congressional officials made clear that they wanted Corney to provide information about the ongoing FBI investigation.311 Dana Boente, who at that time was the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, authorized Corney to confirm the existence of the Russia investigation and agreed that Corney should decline to comment on whether any particular individuals, including the President, were being investigated.312 306 Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 14; see SC_ AD_ 000168 (Donaldson 3/6/17 Notes) (\"POTUS wants to call Dana [then the Acting Attorney General for campaign-related investigations]/ Is investigation I No/ We know something on Flynn/ GSA got contacted by FBI/ There's something hot\"). 307 Corney 11/15/17 302, at 13-14; SNS-Classified-0000140-44 (3/8/17 Email, Gauhar to Page et al.). 308 SC_AD _00188 (Donaldson 3/12/18 Notes).

The \"targets\" were identified in notes taken by Donaldson as \"Flynn (FBI was ~ooking for phone records\"; \"Comey~Manafort (Ukr + Russia, not campaign)\";~ \"Carter Page ($ game)\"; and \"Greek Guy\" (potentially referring to George Papadopoulos, later charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 for lying to the FBI).

Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered by his Recusal Later in 2017, the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who would not be recused. On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the Department of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the Department should be investigating.752 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who was at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton's emails and said, \"Don't have to tell us, just take [a] look.\"753 Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the Department of Justice would comply with that request. 754 Two days later, on October 18, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Wow, FBI confirms report that James Corney drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Corney stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?\"755 On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was \"ANGER & UNITY\" over a \"lack of investigation\" of Clinton arid \"the Corney fix,\" and concluded: \"DO SOMETHTNG!\"756 On December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end of a cabinet meeting.757 During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President again suggested that Sessions could \"unrecuse,\" which Porter linked to taking back supervision of the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton.758 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said, \"T don't know if you could un-recuse yourself. You'd be a hero. Not telling you to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get involved. Can order AG to investigate. I don't want to get involved. I'm not going to get involved.

So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined ... and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!\"769 On August 1, 2018, the President tweeted that '\"Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now.\"770 On August 23, 2018, the President publicly criticized Sessions in a press interview and suggested that prosecutions at the Department of Justice were politically motivated because Paul Manafo11 had been prosecuted but Democrats had not.771 The President said, \"I put in an Attorney General that never took control of the Justice Department, JeffSessions.\"772 That day, Sessions issued a press statement that said, \"I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in .... While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\"773 The next day, the President tweeted a response: '\"Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.' Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the 'other side' including deleted Emails, Corney lies & leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA abuse, Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump campaign, Russian collusion by Dems -and so much more. Open up the papers & documents without redaction? Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!\"774 On November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, the President replaced Sessions with Sessions's chief of staff as Acting Attorney General.775 Analysis In analyzing the President's efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control of the Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidence are relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. To determine if the President's effo11s to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General's recusal covered (\"Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!\"). 769 @realDonaldTrump 6/5/18 (7:31 a.m. ET) Tweet. 770 @realDonaldTrump 8/1 /18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet. 771 Fox & Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 772 Fox & Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 773 Sessions 8/23/18 Press Statement. 774 @real Donald Trump 8/24/18 (6: 17 a.m. ET) Tweet;@ realDonaldTrump 8/24/18 (6:28 a.m. ET) Tweet. 775 @realDonaldTrump 11/7/18 (2:44 p.m. ET) Tweet.

P. 6(e) General to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated, although it is not clear whether the President knew at that time of the FBI's recent request concerning Flynn.306 2. FBI Director Corney Publicly Confirms the Existence of the Russia Investigation in Testimony Before HPSCI On March 9, 2017, Corney briefed the \"Gang of Eight\" congressional leaders about the FBI's investigation of Russian interference, including an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation.307 Although it is unclear whether the President knew of that briefing at the time, notes taken by Annie Donaldson, then McGahn' s chief of staff, on March 12, 2017, state, \"POTUS in panic/chaos ... Need binders to put in front of POTUS. (1) All things related to Russia.\"308 The week after Corney's briefing, the White House Counsel's Office was in contact with SSCI Chairman Senator Richard Burr about the Russia investigations and appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation.309 On March 20, 2017, Corney was scheduled to testify before HPSCI.310 In advance of Corney's testimony, congressional officials made clear that they wanted Corney to provide information about the ongoing FBI investigation.311 Dana Boente, who at that time was the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, authorized Corney to confirm the existence of the Russia investigation and agreed that Corney should decline to comment on whether any particular individuals, including the President, were being investigated.312 306 Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 14; see SC_ AD_ 000168 (Donaldson 3/6/17 Notes) (\"POTUS wants to call Dana [then the Acting Attorney General for campaign-related investigations]/ Is investigation I No/ We know something on Flynn/ GSA got contacted by FBI/ There's something hot\"). 307 Corney 11/15/17 302, at 13-14; SNS-Classified-0000140-44 (3/8/17 Email, Gauhar to Page et al.). 308 SC_AD _00188 (Donaldson 3/12/18 Notes). Donaldson said she was not part of the conversation that led to these notes, and must have been told about it from others. Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 13. 309 Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 14-15. On March 16, 2017, the White House Counsel's Office was briefed by Senator Burr on the existence of \"4-5 targets.\" Donaldson 11 /6/17 302, at 15. The \"targets\" were identified in notes taken by Donaldson as \"Flynn (FBI was ~ooking for phone records\"; \"Comey~Manafort (Ukr + Russia, not campaign)\";~ \"Carter Page ($ game)\"; and \"Greek Guy\" (potentially referring to George Papadopoulos, later charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 for lying to the FBI). SC_AD_00l98 (Donaldson 3/16/17 Notes). Donaldson and McGahn both said they believed these were targets ofSSCI. Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 15; McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 4. But SSCI does not fotmally investigate individuals as \"targets\"; the notes on their face reference the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Corney; and the notes track the background materials prepared by the FBI for Corney's briefing to the Gang of8 on March 9. See SNS-Classified-0000140-44 (3/8/17 Email, Gauhar to Page et al.); see also Donaldson 11 /6/17 302, at 15 (Donaldson could not rule out that Burr had told McGahn those individuals were the FBI's targets). 310 Hearing on Russian Election Tampering Before the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee, I 15th Cong.

P. 6(e) the President.445 Dhillon made a final pitch to the President that Corney should be permitted to resign, but the President refused.446 Around the time the President's letter was finalized, Priebus summoned Spicer and the press team to the Oval Office, where they were told that Corney had been terminated for the reasons stated in the letters by Rosenstein and Sessions.447 To announce Corney's termination, the White House released a statement, which Priebus thought had been dictated by the President.448 In full, the statement read: \"Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Corney that he has been terminated and removed from office. President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\"449 That evening, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was summoned to meet with the President at the White House.450 The President told McCabe that he had fired Corney because of the decisions Corney had made in the Clinton email investigation and for many other reasons.451 The President asked McCabe if he was aware that Corney had told the President three times that he was not under investigation.452 The President also asked McCabe whether many people in the FBI disliked Corney and whether McCabe was part of the \"resistance\" that had disagreed with Corney's decisions in the Clinton investigation.453 McCabe told the President that he knew Corney had told the President he was not under investigation, that most people in the FBI felt positively about Corney, and that McCabe worked \"very closely\" with Corney and was part of all the decisions that had been made in the Clinton investigation.454 445 Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 10; Eisenberg 11/29/17 302, at 15 (providing the view that the President's desire to include the language about not being under investigation was the \"driving animus of the whole thing\"); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 16 (Burnham knew the only line the President cared about was the line that said Corney advised the President on three separate occasions that the President was not under investigation). According to Hunt's notes, the reference to Corney's statement would indicate that \"notwithstanding\" Corney's having informed the President that he was not under investigation, the President was terminating Corney.

P. 6(e) President's decision to terminate Corney was driven by the recommendations the President received from Rosenstein and Sessions.467 In the morning on May 10, 2017, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office.468 The media subsequently reported that during the May 10 meeting the President brought up his decision the prior day to terminate Corney, telling Lavrov and Kislyak: \"T just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off. ... I'm not under investigation.\"469 The President never denied making those statements, and the White House did not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: \"By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Corney created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified information.\"470 Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with Lavrov, he did not look concerned and said of Corney, \"he is crazy.\"471 When McGahn asked the President about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Corney was fired because that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he could get more work done.472 That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe.473 According to a memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to 467 See, e.g., Sarah Sanders, White House Daily Briefing, C-SPAN (May 10, 2017); SCR013_001088 (5/10/17 Email, Hemming to Cheung et al.)

The meeting had been planned on May 2, 2017, during a telephone call between the President and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the meeting date was confirmed on May 5, 2017, the same day the President dictated ideas for the Corney termination letter to Stephen Miller.

P. 6(ej cited Corney's handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired Corney for that reason. But the facts surrounding Corney's handling of the Clinton email investigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the President had made it clear to both Corney and the President's senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted Corney to stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Corney's handling of the Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Corney. The President's draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the press after Corney's termination that the White House had heard from \"countless\" FBI agents who had lost confidence in Corney. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told Corney at their January 27 dinner that \"the people of the FBI really like [him],\" no evidence suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Corney, and Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything. We also considered why it was important to the President that Corney announce publicly that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Corney that the \"cloud\" of \"this Russia business\" was making it difficult to run the country. The President told Sessions and McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that the perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues. The President complained to Rogers that \"the thing with the Russians [ was] messing up\" his ability to get things done with Russia, and told Coats, \"I can't do anything with Russia, there's things I'd like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they're all over me with this.\" The President also may have viewed Corney as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that the President was not under investigation. Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI's interview of Flynn, the President had a one-on-one dinner with Corney, against the advice of senior aides, and told Corney he needed Corney's \"loyalty.\" When the President later asked Corney for a second time to make public that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying \"Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.\" After the President learned of Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney General \"who to investigate.\" In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI's Russia investigation behind him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Corney was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns. Although the President publicly stated during and after the election that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through Michael Cohen, 76</td>\n",

While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\"773 The next day, the President tweeted a response: '\"Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.'

Obstructive act. To determine if the President's effo11s to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General's recusal covered (\"Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!\"). 769 @realDonaldTrump 6/5/18 (7:31 a.m. ET) Tweet. 770 @realDonaldTrump 8/1 /18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet. 771 Fox &amp; Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 772 Fox &amp; Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 773 Sessions 8/23/18 Press Statement. 774 @real Donald Trump 8/24/18 (6: 17 a.m. ET) Tweet;@ realDonaldTrump 8/24/18 (6:28 a.m. ET) Tweet. 775 @realDonaldTrump 11/7/18 (2:44 p.m. ET) Tweet.

(1) All things related to Russia.\"308 The week after Corney's briefing, the White House Counsel's Office was in contact with SSCI Chairman Senator Richard Burr about the Russia investigations and appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation.309 On March 20, 2017, Corney was scheduled to testify before HPSCI.310 In advance of Corney's testimony, congressional officials made clear that they wanted Corney to provide information about the ongoing FBI investigation.311 Dana Boente, who at that time was the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, authorized Corney to confirm the existence of the Russia investigation and agreed that Corney should decline to comment on whether any particular individuals, including the President, were being investigated.312 306 Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 14; see SC_ AD_ 000168 (Donaldson 3/6/17 Notes) (\"POTUS wants to call Dana [then the Acting Attorney General for campaign-related investigations]/ Is investigation I No/ We know something on Flynn/ GSA got contacted by FBI/ There's something hot\"). 307 Corney 11/15/17 302, at 13-14; SNS-Classified-0000140-44 (3/8/17 Email, Gauhar to Page et al.). 308 SC_AD _00188 (Donaldson 3/12/18 Notes).

On March 16, 2017, the White House Counsel's Office was briefed by Senator Burr on the existence of \"4-5 targets.\" Donaldson 11 /6/17 302, at 15. The \"targets\" were identified in notes taken by Donaldson as \"Flynn (FBI was ~ooking for phone records\"; \"Comey~Manafort (Ukr + Russia, not campaign)\";~ \"Carter Page ($ game)\"; and \"Greek Guy\" (potentially referring to George Papadopoulos, later charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001 for lying to the FBI).

But SSCI does not fotmally investigate individuals as \"targets\"; the notes on their face reference the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Corney; and the notes track the background materials prepared by the FBI for Corney's briefing to the Gang of8 on March 9.

Trump informed FBI Director James Corney that he has been terminated and removed from office. President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\"449 That evening, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was summoned to meet with the President at the White House.450 The President told McCabe that he had fired Corney because of the decisions Corney had made in the Clinton email investigation and for many other reasons.451 The President asked McCabe if he was aware that Corney had told the President three times that he was not under investigation.452 The President also asked McCabe whether many people in the FBI disliked Corney and whether McCabe was part of the \"resistance\" that had disagreed with Corney's decisions in the Clinton investigation.453 McCabe told the President that he knew Corney had told the President he was not under investigation, that most people in the FBI felt positively about Corney, and that McCabe worked \"very closely\" with Corney and was part of all the decisions that had been made in the Clinton investigation.454 445 Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 10; Eisenberg 11/29/17 302, at 15 (providing the view that the President's desire to include the language about not being under investigation was the \"driving animus of the whole thing\"); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 16 (Burnham knew the only line the President cared about was the line that said Corney advised the President on three separate occasions that the President was not under investigation).

P. 6(e) President's decision to terminate Corney was driven by the recommendations the President received from Rosenstein and Sessions.467 In the morning on May 10, 2017, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office.468 The media subsequently reported that during the May 10 meeting the President brought up his decision the prior day to terminate Corney, telling Lavrov and Kislyak: \"T just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off. ... I'm not under investigation.\"469 The President never denied making those statements, and the White House did not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: \"By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Corney created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified information.\"470 Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with Lavrov, he did not look concerned and said of Corney, \"he is crazy.\"471 When McGahn asked the President about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Corney was fired because that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he could get more work done.472 That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe.473 According to a memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to 467 See, e.g., Sarah Sanders, White House Daily Briefing, C-SPAN (May 10, 2017); SCR013_001088 (5/10/17 Email, Hemming to Cheung et al.)

P. 6(ej cited Corney's handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired Corney for that reason. But the facts surrounding Corney's handling of the Clinton email investigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the President had made it clear to both Corney and the President's senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted Corney to stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Corney's handling of the Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Corney. The President's draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the press after Corney's termination that the White House had heard from \"countless\" FBI agents who had lost confidence in Corney. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told Corney at their January 27 dinner that \"the people of the FBI really like [him],\" no evidence suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Corney, and Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything. We also considered why it was important to the President that Corney announce publicly that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Corney that the \"cloud\" of \"this Russia business\" was making it difficult to run the country. The President told Sessions and McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that the perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues. The President complained to Rogers that \"the thing with the Russians [ was] messing up\" his ability to get things done with Russia, and told Coats, \"I can't do anything with Russia, there's things I'd like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they're all over me with this.\" The President also may have viewed Corney as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that the President was not under investigation. Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI's interview of Flynn, the President had a one-on-one dinner with Corney, against the advice of senior aides, and told Corney he needed Corney's \"loyalty.\" When the President later asked Corney for a second time to make public that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying \"Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.\" After the President learned of Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney General \"who to investigate.\" In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI's Russia investigation behind him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Corney was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns.

Obstructive act. To determine if the President's effo11s to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation.

The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Corney in which he asked for Corney\\'s loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Corney in which he said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\" Evidence 1.

Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees-the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)-announced that they would conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Corney later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Corney stated: I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts .... As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. The investigation continued under then-Director Corney for the next seven weeks until May 9, 2017, when President Trump fired Corney as FBI Director-an action which is analyzed in Volume II of the rep01t. On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Corney had confirmed in his congressional testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any \""

The releases included private speeches given by Clinton; 177 internal communications between Podesta and other high-ranking members of the Clinton Campaign; 178 and correspondence related to the Clinton Foundation.179 In total, WikiLeaks released over 50,000 documents stolen from Podesta's personal email account.

Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. 186 The GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.187 The GRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity. By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental entities. GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a technique known as \"SQL injection,\" by which malicious code was sent to the state or local website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents).188 In one instance in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE's website. The GRU then gained access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters, 189 and extracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified.190 GRU officers Investigative Technique scanned state and local websites for eriod in July 2016, GRU officers -for vulnerabilities on websites of more than 185 Netyksho Indictment ,i 34; see also SM-2589105-HACK, serial 29 -· Investigative Technique 186 Netyksho Indictment ,i 69. 188 Investigative Technique -50</td>\n",

According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that the emails were not authentic.283 A backup of Smith's computer contained two files that had been downloaded from WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. The files on Smith's computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect when the files were downloaded to Smith's computer. (It appears the creation date was when WikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section III.B.3.c, supra.284) The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their release by WikiLeaks.

Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. 186 The GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.187 The GRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity. By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental entities. GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a technique known as \"SQL injection,\" by which malicious code was sent to the state or local website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents).188 In one instance in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE's website. The GRU then gained access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters, 189 and extracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified.190 GRU officers Investigative Technique scanned state and local websites for eriod in July 2016, GRU officers -for vulnerabilities on websites of more than 185 Netyksho Indictment ,i 34; see also SM-2589105-HACK, serial 29 -· Investigative Technique 186 Netyksho Indictment ,i 69. 188 Investigative Technique -50   \n",
