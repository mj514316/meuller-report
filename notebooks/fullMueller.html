P. 6(e) Guccifer 2.0 persona informed DCLeaks that WikiLeaks was trying to contact DCLeaks and arrange for a way to speak through encrypted emails.170 An analysis of the metadata collected from the WikiLeaks site revealed that the stolen Podesta emails show a creation date of September 19, 2016.171 Based on information about Assange\u0027s computer and its possible operating system, this date may be when the GRU staged the stolen Podesta emails for transfer to WikiLeaks (as the GRU had previously done in July 2016 for the DNC emails).172 The WikiLeaks site also released PDFs and other documents taken from Podesta that were attachments to emails in his account; these documents had a creation date of October 2, 2016, which appears to be the date the attachments were separately staged by WikiLeaks on its site.173 Beginning on September 20, 2016, WikiLeaks and DCLeaks resumed communications in a brief exchange. On September 22, 2016, a DCLeaks email account dcleaksproject@gmail.com sent an email to a WikiLeaks account with the subject \"Submission\" and the message \"Hi from DCLeaks.\" The email contained a PGP-encr ted with the filename \"wiki_mail.txt.gpg.\"174 %\u20acThe email, however, bears a number of similarities to the July 14, 2016 email in which GRU officers used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to give WikiLeaks access to the archive of DNC files.

Mifsud also said that, on the trip, he learned that the Russians had obtained \"dirt\" on candidate Hillary Clinton. As Papadopoulos later stated to the FBI, Mifsud said that the \"dirt\" was in the form of \"emails of Clinton,\" and that they \"have thousands of emails.\"464 On May 6, 2016, 10 days after that meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.465 e. Russia-Related Communications With The Campaign While he was discussing with his foreign contacts a potential meeting of campaign officials with Russian government officials, Papadopoulos kept campaign officials apprised of his efforts. On April 25, 2016, the day before Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the emails, Papadopoulos wrote to senior policy advisor Stephen Miller that \"[t]he Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready,\" and that \"[t]he advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in \u0027neutral\u0027 cities.\"466 On April 27, 2016, after his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos wrote a second message to Miller stating that \"some interesting messages [were] coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.\"467 The same day, Papadopoulos sent a similar email to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, telling Lewandowski that Papadopoulos had \"been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin wanting to host [Trump] and the team when the time is right. \"468 Papadopoulos\u0027 s Russia-related communications with Campaign officials continued throughout the spring and summer of 2016. On May 4, 2016, he forwarded to Lewandowski an email from Timofeev raising the possibility of a meeting in Moscow, asking Lewandowski whether that was \"something we want to move forward with.\"469 The next day, Papadopoulos forwarded the same Timofeev email to Sam Clovis, adding to the top of the email \"Russia update.\"470 He included the same email in a May 21, 2016 message to senior Campaign official Paul Manafort, under the subject line \"Request from Russia to meet Mr. Trump,\" stating that \"Russia has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me 463 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense 14; 4/25/16 Text Messages, Mifsud \u0026 Papadopoulos. 464 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense~ 14. 465 This information is contained in the FBI case-opening document and related materials. iHferfflatiat1. is lu 111 eHfareefflefl.t seHsitive (LES) sHs f!\u0027lttst be trestes ueeersiHgly iH uHy e,cten1al sisseffliHstiatt.

Jared Kushner\u0027s-Continuing Contacts with Simes Between the April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel and the presidential election, Jared Kushner had periodic contacts with Simes.648 Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings and phone conversations, which concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the Campaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes had proposed.649 Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia, and that Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians.650 According to Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of Russian contacts with Kushner, advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts, and told Kushner both that the Campaign should not highlight Russia as an issue and should handle any contacts with Russians with care.651 Kushner generally provided a similar account of his interactions with Simes.652 Among the Kushner-Simes meetings was one held on August 17, 2016, at Simes\u0027 s request, in Kushner\u0027s New York office.

June 9, 2016 Meeting at Trump Tower On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer Aras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the \"Crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia\" as \"part of Russia and its government\u0027s support for Mr. Trump.\" Trump Jr. immediately responded that \"if it\u0027s what you say I love it,\" and arranged the meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.

So am painted as some mysterious link to Putin.\"766 After public reporting on the June 9 meeting began, representatives from the Trump Organization again reached out to participants. On July 10, 2017, Futerfas sent Goldstone an email with a proposed statement for Goldstone to issue, which read: As the person who arranged the meeting, I can definitively state that th~ statements I have read by Donald Trump Jr. are 100% accurate. The meeting was a complete waste of time and Don was never told Ms. Veselnitskaya\u0027s name prior to the meeting. Ms. Veselnitskaya mostly talked about the Magnitsky Act and Russian adoption laws and the meeting lasted 20 to 30 minutes at most.

Yanukovych gave Manafort a large jar of black caviar that was worth approximately $30,000 to $40,000.915 Manafort\u0027s identification ofYanukovych as \"the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar\" is consistent with Kilimnik being in Moscow-where Yanukovych resided-when Kilimnik wrote \"I met today with~ a December 2016 email in which Kilimnik referred to Yanukovych as \"BG,\"-916 Manafort replied to Kilimnik\u0027s July 29 email, \"Tuesday [August 2] is best ...

But their versions of events, when assessed alongside available documentary evidence and what Kilimnik told business associate Sam Patten, indicate that at least three principal topics were discussed.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) Overarching factual issues. We did not make a traditional prosecution decision about these facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President\u0027s conduct. Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises constitutional issues discussed below. At the same time, the President\u0027s position as the head of the Executive Branch provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses-all of which is relevant to a potential obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. Although the obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of the President\u0027s intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third, many of the President\u0027s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the obstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to the justice system\u0027s integrity is the same.

P. 6(c) On February 9, 2017, the Washington Post reported that Flynn discussed sanctions with Kislyak the month before the President took office.197 After the publication of that story, Vice President Pence learned of the Department of Justice\u0027s notification to the White House about the content of Flynn\u0027s calls.198 He and other advisors then sought access to and reviewed the underlying information about Flynn\u0027s contacts with Kislyak.199 FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who provided the White House officials access to the information and was present when they reviewed it, recalled the officials asking him whether Flynn\u0027s conduct violated the Logan Act.200 McCabe responded that he did not know, but the FBI was investigating the matter because it was a possibility.201 Based on the evidence of Flynn\u0027s contacts with Kislyak, McGahn and Priebus concluded that Flynn could not have forgotten the details of the discussions of sanctions and had instead been lying about what he discussed with Kislyak.202 Flynn had also told White House officials that the FB[ had told him that the FBI was closing out its investigation of him,203 but Eisenberg did not believe him.204 After reviewing the materials and speaking with Flynn, McGahn and Priebus concluded that Flynn should be terminated and recommended that course of action to the President.205 That weekend, Flynn accompanied the President to Mar-a-Lago.206 Flynn recalled that on February 12, 2017, on the return flight to D.C. on Air Force One, the President asked him whether he had lied to the Vice President.207 Flynn responded that he may have forgotten details of his calls, but he did not think he lied.208 The President responded, \"Okay.

P. 6(e) Corney\u0027s public announcement of the FBT\u0027s Russia investigation, is nevertheless relevant to understanding what motivated the President\u0027s other actions towards the investigation. The evidence shows that the President was focused on the Russia investigation\u0027s implications for his presidency-and, specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he was under investigation or had links to Russia. In early March, the President attempted to prevent Sessions\u0027s recusal, even after being told that Sessions was following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules. After Sessions recused, the White House Counsel\u0027s Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions about the matter, although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President. The President continued to raise the issue of Sessions\u0027s recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse. The President also told advisors that he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him, the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The Pr.esident made statements about being able to direct the course of criminal investigations, saying words to the effect of, \"You\u0027re telling me that Bobby and Jack didn\u0027t talk about investigations?

P. 6(e) President intended Manafort to believe that he could receive a pardon, which would make cooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary. We also examined the evidence of the President\u0027s intent in making public statements about Manafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating. Some evidence supports a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence the jury. The trial generated widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators suggested that an acquittal would add to pressure to end the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation. By publicly stating on the second day of deliberations that Manafort \"happens to be a very good person\" and that \"it\u0027s very sad what they\u0027ve done to Paul Manafort\" right after calling the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation a \"rigged witch hunt,\" the President\u0027s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural tendency to engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a factfinder could infer that the President intended that result. But there are alternative explanations for the President\u0027s comments, including that he genuinely felt sorry for Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury but to influence public opinion. The President\u0027s comments also could have been intended to continue sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above, the President made his comments about Manafort being \"a very good person\" immediately after declining to answer a question about whether he would pardon Manafort. 133 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_767", "label": "par_767", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atte\u003ef\u0027flC)\" \u0027ifeFk Prnauet // Mtt) Centttin Mttl:eFittl Preteet:ea Unaer Feel. R. CFiffl. P. 6(e) commencement or conduct of a proceeding, and not just to acts that make evidence unavailable or impair its integrity. Section 1512(c)(2)\u0027s breadth is reinforced by the similarity of its language to the omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, which covers anyone who \"corruptly ... obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.\" That clause of Section 1503 follows two more specific clauses that protect jurors, judges, and court officers. The omnibus clause has nevertheless been construed to be \"far more general in scope than the earlier clauses of the statute.\" United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995). \"The omnibus clause is essentially a catch-all provision which generally prohibits conduct that interferes with the due administration of justice.\" United States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 1997). Courts have accordingly given it a \"non-restrictive reading.\" United States v. Kumar, 617 F .3d 612, 620 (2d Cir. 201 O); id. at 620 n.7 (collecting cases from the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits). As one court has explained, the omnibus clause \"prohibits acts that are similar in result, rather than manner, to the conduct described in the first part of the statute.\" United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d 1331, 1333 (5th Cir. 1978). While the specific clauses \"forbid certain means of obstructing justice ... the omnibus clause aims at obstruction of justice itself, regardless of the means used to reach that result.\" Id. ( collecting cases). Given the similarity of Section 1512( c )(2) to Section 1503 \u0027s omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts that produced a similar result to the evidence-impairment provisions-i.e., the result of obstructing justice-rather than covering only acts that were similar in manner. Read this way, Section 1512( c )(2) serves a distinct function in the federal obstruction-of-justice statutes: it captures corrupt conduct, other than document destruction, that has the natural tendency to obstruct contemplated as well as pending proceedings. Section 1512( c )(2) overlaps with other obstruction statutes, but it does not render them superfluous. Section 1503, for example, which covers pending grand jury and judicial proceedings, and Section 1505, which covers pending administrative and congressional proceedings, reach \"endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede\" the proceedings-a broader test for inchoate violations than Section 1512(c)(2)\u0027s \"attempt\" standard, which requires a substantial step towards a completed offense. See United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287,302 (2d Cir.2018) (\"[E]fforts to witness tamper that rise to the level of an \u0027endeavor\u0027 yet fall short of an \u0027attempt\u0027 cannot be prosecuted under\u00a7 1512.\"); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988) (collecting cases recognizing the difference between the \"endeavor\" and \"attempt\" standards). And 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519, which prohibits destruction of documents or records in contemplation of an investigation or proceeding, does not require the \"nexus\" showing under Aguilar, which Section 1512( c )(2) demands. See, e.g., United States v. Yielding, 657 F .3d 688, 712 (8th Cir.2011) (\"The requisite knowledge and intent [ under Section 1519] can be present even if the accused lacks knowledge that he is likely to succeed in obstructing the matter.\"); United States v. Gray, 642 F.3d 371, 376-377 (2d Cir. 2011) (\"[I]n enacting\u00a7 1519, Congress rejected any requirement that the government prove a link between a defendant\u0027s conduct and an imminent or pending official proceeding.\"). The existence of even \"substantial\" overlap is not \"uncommon\" in criminal statutes. Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 359 n.4; see Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 458-469; Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"The fact that there is now some overlap between\u00a7 1503 and \u00a7 1512 is no more intolerable than the fact that there is some overlap between the omnibus clause of\u00a7 1503 and the other provisions of\u00a7 1503 itself.\").

And it would be contrary to ordinary rules of statutory construction to adopt an unconventional meaning of a statutory term only when applied to the President. See United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (rejecting proposal to \"giv[e] the same word, in the same statutory provision, different meanings in different factual contexts\"); cf Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 462-467 (giving the term \"utilized\" in the F ACA a uniform meaning to avoid constitutional questions). Nor could such an exclusion draw on a separate and established background interpretive presumption, such as the presumption against extraterritoriality applied in Sale. The principle that courts will construe a statute to avoid serious constitutional questions \"is not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.\" Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 59-60 ( 1997). \"It is one thing to acknowledge and accept ... well defined ( or even newly enunciated), generally applicable, background principles of assumed legislative intent. It is quite another to espouse the broad proposition that criminal statutes do not have to be read as broadly as they are written, but are subject to case-by-case exceptions.\" Brogan v. United States, 522 U.S. 398, 406 (1998). When a proposed construction \"would thus function as an extra-textual limit on [a statute\u0027s] compass,\" thereby preventing the statute \"from applying to a host of cases falling within its clear terms,\" Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357, it is doubtful that the construction would reflect Congress\u0027s intent. That is particularly so with respect to obstruction statutes, which \"have been given a broad and all-inclusive meaning.\" Rainey, 757 F .3d at 245 ( discussing Sections 1503 and 1505) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, since no established principle of interpretation would exclude the presidential conduct we have investigated from statutes such as Sections 1503, 1505, I 512(b), and l 512(c)(2), we proceed to examine the separation-of-powers issues that could be raised as an Article II defense to the application of those statutes. 2. Separation-of-Powers Principles Support the Conclusion that Congress May Validly Prohibit Corrupt Obstructive Acts Carried Out Through the President\u0027s Official Powers When Congress imposes a limitation on the exercise of Article II powers, the limitation\u0027s validity depends on whether the measure \"disrupts the balance between the coordinate branches.\" Nixon v.

Congress Has Power to Protect Congressional, Grand Jury, and Judicial Proceedings Against Corrupt Acts from Any Source Where a law imposes a burden on the President\u0027s performance of Article II functions, separation-of-powers analysis considers whether the statutory measure \"is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.\" Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443. Here, Congress enacted the obstruction-ofjustice statutes to protect, among other things, the integrity of its own proceedings, grand jury investigations, and federal criminal trials. Those objectives are within Congress\u0027s authority and serve strong governmental interests. i. Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it to all persons-including the President. Congress clearly has authority to protect its own legislative functions against corrupt efforts designed to impede legitimate fact-gathering and lawmaking efforts. See Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187, 206-207 (1957); Chapman v. United States, 5 App. D.C. 122, 130 ( 1895).

R. Crim. P. 6(e) official power is being used for the purpose of protecting the President\u0027s personal interests. In contrast, the President\u0027s actions to serve political or policy interests would not qualify as corrupt. The President\u0027s role as head of the government necessarily requires him to take into account political factors in making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings. For instance, the President\u0027s decision to curtail a law-enforcement investigation to avoid international friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes. The criminal law does not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy factors in the conduct of government. And when legitimate interests animate the President\u0027s conduct, those interests will almost invariably be readily identifiable based on objective factors. Because the President\u0027s conduct in those instances will obviously fall outside the zone of obstruction law, no chilling concern should arise. b. There is also no reason to believe that investigations, let alone prosecutions, would occur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to believe that obstruction occurred. Prosecutorial action enjoys a presumption of regularity: absent \"clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official duties.\" Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. I, 14-15 (1926)). The presumption of prosecutorial regularity would provide even greater protection to the President than exists in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any matter involving the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough and careful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice. Under OLC\u0027s opinion that a sitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment, only a successor Administration would be able to prosecute a former President. But that consideration does not suggest that a President would have any basis for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office. There are \"obvious political checks\" against initiating a baseless investigation or prosecution of a former President. See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 448 (considering political checks in separation-of-powers analysis).

Carter Page Carter Page worked for the Trump Campaign from January 2016 to September 2016. He was formally and publicly announced as a foreign policy advisor by the candidate in March 2016.516 Page had lived and worked in Russia, and he had been approached by Russian intelligence officers several years before he volunteered for the Trump Campaign. During his time with the Campaign, Page advocated pro-Russia foreign policy positions and traveled to Moscow in his personal capacity. Russian intelligence officials had formed relationships with Page in 2008 and 2013 and Russian officials may have focused on Page in 2016 because of his affiliation with the Campaign. However, the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. 508 7 /31/16 Email, Denysyk to Papadopoulos (21 :54:52). 509 8/23/16 Facebook Message, Millian to Papadopoulos (2:55:36 a.m.). 510 Papadopoulos 9/20/17 302, at 2. 511 11/10/16 Facebook Message, Millian to Papadopoulos (9:35:05 p.m.). 512 11/14/16 Facebook Message, Millian to Papadopoulos (1 :32: 11 a.m.). 513 Papadopoulos 9/19/17 302, at 19. 514 E.g., 11/29/16 Facebook Messages, Papadopoulos \u0026 Millian (5:09 -5:11 p.m.); 12/7/16 Facebook Message, Millian to Papadopoulos (5:10:54 p.m.). 515 1/20/17 Facebook Messages, Papadopoulos \u0026 Millian (4:37-4:39 a.m.). 516 Page was interviewed b Counsel\u0027s appointment. 95 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_219", "label": "par_219", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice At-teri\u0027l:ey \u0027.Verk Pree1::1et // May CeHtail\u0027l: Material Preteetee Ul\u0027l:eer Fee.

For example, on January 30, 2016, Page sent an email to senior Campaign officials stating that he had \"spent the past week in Europe and ha[ d] been in discussions with some individuals with close ties to the Kremlin\" who recognized that Trump could have a \"game-changing effect ... in bringing the end of the new Cold War.\"542 The email stated that \"[t]hrough [his] discussions with these high level contacts,\" Page believed that \"a direct meeting in Moscow between Mr[.] Trump and Putin could be arran ed.\"543 Pa e closed the email b criticizin U.S. sanctions on Russia.544 On March 21, 2016, candidate Trump formally and publicly identified Page as a member of his foreign policy team to advise on Russia and the energy sector.546 Over the next several months, Page continued providing policy-related work product to Campaign officials. For example, in April 2016, Page provided feedback on an outline for a foreign policy speech that the candidate gave at the Mayflower Hotel,547 see Volume I, Section IV.A.4, infra. In May 2016, Page prepared an outline of an energy policy speech for the Campaign and then traveled to Bismarck, North Dakota, to watch the candidate deliver the speech.548 Chief policy advisor Sam Clovis expressed appreciation for Page\u0027s work and praised his work to other Campaign officials.549 c.

That interaction and a discussion of the December trip are set forth in Volume I, Section IV.B.6, infra. 4. Dimitri Simes and the Center for the National Interest Members of the Trump Campaign interacted on several occasions with the Center for the National Interest (CNI), principally through its President and Chief Executive Officer, Dimitri Simes. CNI is a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian government. Simes was born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s. In April 2016, candidate Trump delivered his first speech on foreign policy and national security at an event hosted by the National Interest, a publication affiliated with CNI. Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and Russian Ambassador Kislyak both attended the event and, as a result, it gained some attention in relation to Sessions\u0027s confirmation hearings to become Attorney General. Sessions had various other contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including Russia. Jared Kushner also interacted with Simes about Russian issues during the campaign. The investigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messages to or from the Russian government through CNI or Simes. a. CNI and Dimitri Simes Connect with the Trump Campaign CNI is a Washington-based non-profit organization that grew out of a center founded by former President Richard Nixon.593 CNI describes itself \"as a voice for strategic realism in U.S. foreign policy,\" and publishes a bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, the National Interest.594 CNI is overseen by a board of directors and an advisory council that is largely honorary and whose members at the relevant time included Sessions, who served as an advisor to candidate Trump on national security and foreign policy issues.595 Dimitri Simes is president and CEO of CNI and the publisher and CEO of the National Jnterest.596 Simes was born in the former Soviet Union, emigrated to the United States in the early 1970s, and joined CNI\u0027 s predecessor after working at the Carnegie Endowment for International 593 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 1-2. 594 About the Center, CNI, available at https://cftni.org/about/. 595 Advisory Counsel, CNl, available at https://web.archive.org/web/20161030025331/ http://cftni.org/about/advisory-council/; Simes 3/8/18 302, at 3-4; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 4; Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 16. 596 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 2. 103 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 13}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_226", "label": "par_226", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterttey Werk Preflttet // Moy CeRtttift Material PrnteeteEI Uttfler Fee.

As CNI stated when seeking a grant from the Carnegie Corporation in 2015, CNI has \"unparalleled access to Russian officials and politicians among Washington think tanks,\"599 in part because CNI has arranged for U.S. delegations to visit Russia and for Russian delegations to visit the United States as patt of so-called \"Track 11\" diplomatic \u00b7 efforts.600 On March 14, 2016, CNI board member Richard Plepler organized a luncheon for CNI and its honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York.601 The idea behind the event was to generate interest in CNI\u0027s work and recruit new board members for CNI.602 Along with Simes, attendees at the event included Jared Kushner, son-in-law of candidate Trump.603 Kushner told the Office that the event came at a time when the Trump Campaign was having trouble securing support from experienced foreign policy professionals and that, as a result, he decided to seek Simes\u0027s assistance during the March \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 10}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_233", "label": "par_233", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e the event but then departed for Capitol Hill.633 Saunders recalled, based in part on a food-related request he received from a Campaign staff member, that Trump left the hotel a few minutes after the speech to go to the airport. 634 c. Jeff Sessions\u0027s Post-Speech Interactions with CNI In the wake of Sessions\u0027 s confirmation hearings as Attorney General, questions arose about whether Sessions\u0027s campaign-period interactions with CNI apart from the Mayflower speech included any additional meetings with Ambassador Kislyak or involved Russian-related matters. With respect to Kislyak contacts, on May 23, 2016, Sessions attended CNI \u0027s Distinguished Service Award dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C.635 Sessions attended a pre-dinner reception and was seated at one of two head tables for the event. 636 A seating chart prepared by Saunders indicates that Sessions was scheduled to be seated next to Kislyak, who appears to have responded to the invitation by indicating he would attend the event.637 Sessions, however, did not remember seeing, speaking with, or sitting next to Kislyak at the dinner.638 Although CNI board member Charles Boyd said he may have seen Kislyak at the dinner,639 Simes, Saunders, and Jacob Heilbrunn--editor of the National Interest-all had no recollection of seeing Kislyak at the May 23 event.64\u00b0 Kislyak also does not appear in any of the photos from the event that the Office obtained. In the summer of 2016, CNI organized at least two dinners in Washington, D.C. for Sessions to meet with experienced foreign policy professionals.641 The dinners included affiliated individuals, such as Richard Burt and Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq and the person who had introduced Trump before the April 27, 2016 foreign-632 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 22; Heilbrunn 2/1/18 302, at 7. 633 Luff 1 /30/18 302, at 4. 634 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 15. 635 Sessions 1/17 /18 302, at 22; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 17. 636 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 17; C00004779-80 (5/23/16 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 11}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_267", "label": "par_267", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attomey \\Vork Prodttet // May Cofltaifl: Material Proteeted Uflcler Fecl.

Gordon stated that he connected with both of them (he could not recall if by phone or in person) and apprised them of the language he took issue with in the proposed amendment. Gordon recalled no objection by either Dearborn or Mashburn and that all three Campaign advisors supported the alternative formulation (\"appropriate assistance\").809 Dearborn recalled Gordon warning them about the amendment, but not weighing in because Gordon was more familiar with the Campaign\u0027s foreign policy stance.810 Mashburn stated that Gordon reached him, and he told Gordon that Trump had not taken a stance on the issue and that the Campaign should not intervene.811 When the amendment came up again in the committee\u0027s proceedings, the subcommittee changed the amendment by striking the \"lethal defense weapons\" language and replacing it with 801 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 3. 802 M.

Oct. 5, 2017), Doc. 19 (\"Papadopoulos Statement of Offense\"). Papadopoulos also made false statements in an effort to mmumze the extent and importance of his communications with Mifsud. For example, Papadopoulos stated that \"[Mifsud]\u0027s a nothing,\" that he thought Mifsud was \"just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something,\" and that he believed Mifsud was \"BS\u0027ing to be completely honest with you.\" In fact, however, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to have substantial connections to high-level Russian government officials and that Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling Papadopoulos about the \"dirt.\" Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over a period of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign, including efforts to arrange a \"history making\" meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials. In addition, Papadopoulos failed to inform investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev, the Russian national who Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or \"[a]nyone with a Russian accent\" during the campaign. Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r,r 27-29. Papadopoulos also falsely claimed that he met Polonskaya before he joined the Campaign, and falsely told the FBI that he had \"no\" relationship at all with her. He stated that the extent of their communications was her sending emails-\"Just, \u0027Hi, how are you?\u0027 That\u0027s it.\" In truth, however, Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he had joined the Campaign; he believed that she had connections to high-level Russian government officials and could help him arrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia. During the campaign he emailed and spoke with her over Skype on numerous occasions about the potential foreign policy trip to Russia. Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r,r 30-31. Papadopoulos\u0027s false statements in January 2017 impeded the FBI\u0027s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, those statements hindered investigators\u0027 ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby of a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017. See Gov\u0027t Sent. Mem. at 6, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. 1 :17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44. During that interview, Mifsud admitted to knowing Papadopoulos and to having introduced him to Polonskaya and Timofeev. But Mifsud denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of emails damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their conversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulos since the meeting at which Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even though emails, text messages, and other information show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions-April 12 and April 26, 2016. In addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up message that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that, as reflected in the language of that email chain (\"Baby, thank you!\"), Mifsud may have been involved in a personal relationship with Polonskaya at the time. The false information and omissions in Papadopoulos\u0027s January 2017 interview undermined investigators\u0027 ability to challenge Mifsud when he made these inaccurate statements. 193 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 16}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_568", "label": "par_568", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AUoffle\u0027.Y Work Proeuet // May CoRtaifl Material Proteetee Ufl:eer Fee.

Accordingly, the President accepted the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Corney from his position.\"479 In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to review Corney\u0027s performance and that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to come to the President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Corney. When a reporter indicated that the \"vast majority\" of FBI agents supported Corney, Sanders said, \"Look, we\u0027ve heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.\"48\u00b0 Following the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments.481 Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from \"countless members of the FBI\" was a \"slip of the tongue.\"482 She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Corney was a comment she made \"in the heat of the moment\" that was not founded on anything.483 Also on May I 0, 2017, Sessions and Rosenstein each spoke to McGahn and expressed concern that the White House was creating a narrative that Rosenstein had initiated the decision to 474 McCabe 5/10/l 7 Memorandum, at 1. 475 McCabe 5/ I 0/17 Memorandum, at I. 476 McCabe 5/10/17 Memorandum, at I; Rybicki 6/13/17 302, at 2.

I just want to be treated fairly.\" The duration of the President\u0027s efforts-which spanned from March 2017 to August 2018-and the fact that the President repeatedly criticized Sessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is relevant to assessing whether the President\u0027s effotts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as obstructive acts. b. Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. In addition, in July 2017, a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the District of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August 2017.776 Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on those proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the obstructive-act element. c. Intent. There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President\u0027s conduct toward Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope. By the summer of 2017, the President was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating him personally for obstruction of justice. And in the wake of the disclosures of emails about the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the campaign, see Volume IT, Section TI.G, supra, it was evident that the investigation into the campaign now included the President\u0027s son, son-in-law, and former campaign manager. The President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference. Yet Sessions remained recused. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to Sessions in the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if he unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President\u0027s desire that Sessions take back supervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary Clinton. The President said in that meeting that he \"just want[ ed] to be treated fairly,\" which could reflect his perception that it was unfair that he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. But a principal effect of that act would be to restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the Attorney General-a position that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by someone like Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their 776 E.g., Del Quentin Wilbur \u0026 Byron Tau, Special Counsel Robert Mueller Impanels Washington Grand Jury in Russia Probe, Wall Street Journal (Aug. 3, 2017); Carol D.

R. Criffi. P. 6(e) are presumed to follow those instructions, the President\u0027s statements during the trial generated substantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if they happened to see the statements or learned about them from others. And the President\u0027s statements during jury deliberations that Manafort \"happens to be a very good person\" and that \"it\u0027s very sad what they\u0027ve done to Paul Mana fort\" had the potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements, which the President made just as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit Manafort. b. Nexus to an official proceeding. The President\u0027s actions towards Flynn, Manafort, --appear to have been connected to pending or ~d official proceedings involving each individual. The President\u0027s conduct towards Flynn~ principally occurred when both were under criminal investigation by the Special Counsel\u0027s Office and press reports speculated about whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation. And the President\u0027s conduct towards Manafort was directly connected to the official proceedings involving him. The President made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort\u0027s criminal trial. And the President\u0027s comments about the prospect of Manafort \"flipping\" occurred when it was clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings. c. Intent. Evidence concerning the President\u0027s intent related to Flynn as a potential witness is inconclusive. As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have evidence establishing whether the President knew about or was involved in his counsel\u0027s communications with Flynn\u0027s counsel stating that Flynn\u0027s decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement and cooperate with the government would be viewed as reflecting \"hostility\" towards the President. And regardless of what the President\u0027s personal counsel communicated, the President continued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, stating that Flynn had \"led a very strong life\" and the President \"fe[lt] very badly\" about what had happened to him. Evidence concerning the President\u0027s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before Manafort was convicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated unfairly. One day after Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially faced a lengthy prison term, the President said that Manafort was \"a brave man\" for refusing to \"break\" and that \"flipping\" \"almost ought to be outlawed.\" At the same time, although the President had privately told aides he did not like Manafort, he publicly called Mana fort \"a good man\" and said he had a \"wonderful family.\" And when the President was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the President did not respond directly and instead said he had \"great respect for what [Manafort]\u0027s done, in terms of what he\u0027s gone through.\" The President added that \"some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.\" In light of the President\u0027s counsel\u0027s previous statements that the investigations \"might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons\" and that a pardon would be possible if the President \"come[s] to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly,\" the evidence supports the inference that the 132 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_2", "label": "par_2", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice At:t:ef\u0027fle)\u0027 Werle Predttet /,\u0027 Ma;\u00b7 CeHtail\u0027l Material Preteeted UHder Fed.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 599-602. In several obstruction cases, the Court has imposed a nexus test that requires that the wrongful conduct targeted by the provision be sufficiently connected to an official proceeding to ensure the requisite culpability. Marinello, 138 S. Ct. at 1109; Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 707-708; Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600-602. Section 1512(c)(2) has been interpreted to require a similar nexus. See, e.g., United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 4 79 F .3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). To satisfy the nexus requirement, the government must show as an objective matter that a defendant acted \"in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,\" such that the statute \"excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful.\" Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at 599 (\"the endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice\") (internal quotation marks omitted). The government must also show as a subjective matter that the actor \"contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.\" Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445. Those requirements alleviate fair-warning concerns by ensuring that obstructive conduct has a close enough connection to existing or future proceedings to implicate the dangers targeted by the obstruction laws and that the individual actually has the obstructive result in mind. b. Courts also seek to construe statutes to avoid due process vagueness concerns. See, e.g., McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2016); Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 368, 402-404 (2010). Vagueness doctrine requires that a statute define a crime \"with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\" and \"in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\" Id. at 402-403 (internal quotation marks omitted). The obstruction statutes\u0027 requirement of acting \"corruptly\" satisfies that test. \"Acting \u0027corruptly\u0027 within the meaning of\u00a7 1512(c)(2) means acting with an improper purpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, impede or obstruct\" the relevant proceeding. United States v. Gordon, 710 F .3d 1 124, I 151 (10th Cir. 2013) (some quotation marks omitted). The majority opinion in Aguilar did not address the defendant\u0027s vagueness challenge to the word \"corruptly,\" 515 U.S. at 600 n. 1, but Justice Scalia\u0027s separate opinion did reach that issue and would have rejected the challenge, id. at 616-617 (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \"Statutory language need not be colloquial,\" Justice Scalia explained, and \"the term \u0027corruptly\u0027 in criminal laws has a longstanding and well-accepted meaning. It denotes an act done with an intent to give some advantage inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.\" Id. at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted; citing lower court authority and legal dictionaries). Justice Scalia added that \"in the context of obstructing jury proceedings, any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is incredible.\" Id. at 617. Lower courts have also rejected vagueness challenges to the word \"corruptly.\" See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 869 F.3d 490, 501-502 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1280-1281 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d 1331, 1336 n.9 (5th Cir. 1978). This well-established intent standard precludes the need to limit the obstruction statutes to only certain kinds of inherently wrongful conduct.1083 1083 In United States v. Poindexter, 951 F .2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991 ), the court of appeals found the term \"corruptly\" in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 vague as applied to a person who provided false information to Congress.

Rosenstein-then serving as Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation following the recusal of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 2, 2016-appointed the Special Counsel \"to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\" Office of the Deputy Att\u0027y Gen., Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters, May 17, 2017) (\"Appointment Order\"). Relying on \"the authority vested\" in the Acting Attorney General, \"including 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 509, 510, and 515,\" the Acting Attorney General ordered the appointment of a Special Counsel \"in order to discharge [the Acting Attorney General\u0027s] responsibility to provide supervision and management of the Department of Justice, and to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government\u0027s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\" Appointment Order (introduction). \"The Special Counsel,\" the Order stated, \"is authorized to conduct the investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Corney in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017,\" including: \u0027 (i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and (ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and (iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a). Appointment Order ,r (b). Section 600.4 affords the Special Counsel \"the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a). The authority to investigate \"any matters that arose ... directly from the investigation,\" Appointment Order ,r (b)(ii), covers similar crimes that may have occurred during the course of the FBI\u0027s confirmed investigation before the Special Counsel\u0027s appointment. \"If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate,\" the Order further provided, \"the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters.\" Id. ,r ( c ). Finally, the Acting Attorney General made applicable \"Sections 600.4 through 600.10 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\" Id. ,r (d). The Acting Attorney General further clarified the scope of the Special Counsel\u0027s investigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda. A memorandum dated August 2, 2017, explained that the Appointment Order had been \"worded categorically in order to permit its public release without confirming specific investigations involving specific individuals.\" It then confirmed that the Special Counsel had been authorized since his appointment to investigate allegations that three Trump campaign officials-Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and George Papadopoulos-\"committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government\u0027s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.\" The memorandum also confirmed the Special Counsel\u0027s authority to investigate certain other matters, including two additional sets of allegations involving Manafort (crimes arising from payments he received from the Ukrainian government and crimes arising from his receipt of loans 11 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 10}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_54", "label": "par_54", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice A\u00ab:eme:,\u00b7 Wefk Pfedttet // Ma:,\u00b7 Cefl:taifl: Matefial Pfeteeted Ufl:def Fee.

The statutes comprising the NSPA cover \"goods, wares, or merchandise,\" and lower coutts have largely understood that phrase to be limited to tangible items since the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in Dowling v.

Brown, 925 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1991)-specifically held that the NSPA does not reach \"a computer program in source code form,\" even though that code was stored in tangible items (i.e., a hard disk and in a three-ring notebook). Id. at 1302-03. Congress, in turn, cited the Brown opinion in explaining the need for amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(2) that \"would ensure that the theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft of physical items [is] protected.\" S.

P. 6(e) historic proportion!\"266 In late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a message to Flynn telling him the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong.267 Analysis In analyzing the President\u0027s conduct related to the Flynn investigation, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. According to Corney\u0027s account of his February 14, 2017 meeting in the Oval Office, the President told him, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go .... I hope you can let this go.\" In analyzing whether these statements constitute an obstructive act, a threshold question is whether Corney\u0027s account of the interaction is accurate, and, if so, whether the President\u0027s statements had the tendency to impede the administration of justice by shutting down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal charge. After Corney\u0027s account of the President\u0027s request to \"let[] Flynn go\" became public, the President publicly disputed several aspects of the story. The President told the New York Times that he did not \"shoo other people out of the room\" when he talked to Corney and that he did not remember having a one-on-one conversation with Comey.268 The President also publicly denied that he had asked Corney to \"let[] Flynn go\" or otherwise communicated that Corney should drop the investigation ofFlynn.269 In private, the President denied aspects of Corney\u0027s account to White House advisors, but acknowledged to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Corney and stated that Flynn was a good guy.270 Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates Corney\u0027s account. 266 @realDonaldTrump 3/31 /l 7 (7:04 a.m. ET) Tweet; see Shane Harris at al., Mike Flynn Offers to Testify in Exchange for Immunity, Wall Street Journal (Mar. 30, 2017). 267McFarland 12/22/17 302, at 18. 268 Excerpts From The Times \u0027s Interview With Trump, New York Times (July 19, 2017).

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) K. The President\u0027s Conduct Involving Michael Cohen Overview The President\u0027s conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our investigation. During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the media began questioning Trump\u0027s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a \"party line\" that publicly distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen continued to adhere to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its Russia investigation. [n an attempt to minimize the President\u0027s connections to Russia, Cohen submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower Moscow project three times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen had not received a response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While working on the congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President\u0027s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the statement short and \"tight.\" After the FBI searched Cohen\u0027s home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not \"flip\" and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President\u0027s personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do \"something else\" to make the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a \"rat,\" and suggested his family members had committed crimes. Evidence 1. Candidate Trump\u0027s Awareness of and Involvement m the Trump Tower Moscow Project The President\u0027s interactions with Cohen as a witness took place against the background of the President\u0027s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project. As described in detail in Volume I, Section IV.A. 1, supra, from September 2015 until at least June 2016, the Trump Organization pursued a Trump Tower Moscow project in Russia, with negotiations conducted by Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.909 The Trump Organization had previously and 909 In August 2018 and November 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple crimes of deception, including making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, as described later in this section. When Cohen first met with investigators from this Office, he repeated the same lies he told Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project. Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 12-17. But after Cohen pleaded guilty to offenses in the Southern District ofNew York on August 21, 2018, he met with investigators again and corrected the record. The Office found Cohen\u0027s testimony in these subsequent proffer sessions to be consistent with and corroborated by other information obtained in the course of the Office\u0027s investigation. The Office\u0027s sentencing submission in Cohen\u0027s criminal case stated: \"Starting with his second meeting with the [Special Counsel\u0027s Office] in September 2018, the defendant has accepted responsibility not only for 134 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_740", "label": "par_740", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice ,r\\M;e,rHe,\u00b7 \u0027.Ve,rk Pre,ettet // Ma,\u00b7 Cm1:taiH Material Pre,teetea UHaer Fee.

Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!\"1043 On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to eight felony charges, including two counts of campaign-finance violations based on the payments he had made during the final weeks of the campaign to women who said they had affairs with the President.1044 During the plea hearing, Cohen stated that he had worked \"at the direction of\u0027 the candidate in making those payments.1045 The next day, the President contrasted Cohen\u0027s cooperation with Manafort\u0027s refusal to cooperate, tweeting, \"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. \u0027Justice\u0027 took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to \u0027break\u0027-make up stories in order to get a \u0027deal.\u0027 Such respect for a brave man!\"1046 On September 17, 2018, this Office submitted written questions to the President that included questions about the Trump Tower Moscow project and attached Cohen\u0027s written statement to Congress and the Letter of Intent signed by the President.1047 Among other issues, the questions asked the President to describe the timing and substance of discussions he had with Cohen about the project, whether they discussed a potential trip to Russia, and whether the President \"at any time direct[ ed] or suggest[ ed] that discussions about the Trump Moscow project should cease,\" or whether the President was \"informed at any time that the project had been abandoned.\"1048 On November 20, 2018, the President submitted written responses that did not answer those questions about Trump Tower Moscow directly and did not provide any information about the timing of the candidate\u0027s discussions with Cohen about the project or whether he participated in any discussions about the project being abandoned or no longer pursued.1049 Instead, the President\u0027s answers stated in relevant part: I had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject. As I recall; they were brief, and they were not memorable. I was not enthused about the proposal, and I do not recall any discussion of travel to Russia in connection with it.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) V. PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel\u0027s Office \"to prosecute federal crimes arising from [its] investigation\" of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to exercise this prosecutorial authority, the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney\u0027s) Manual. In particular, the Office has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for prosecution constituted a federal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction for such an offense. Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those questions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction, and there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution. Id. As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of Russian nationals for their roles in er etratin the active-measures social media cam ai n and similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of campaign-finance offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction. At the same time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging certain individuals connected to the Campaign with making false statements or otherwise obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations. A. Russian \"Active Measures\" Social Media Campaign On February 16, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment charging 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities-including the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Concord Management and Consulting LLC (Concord)-with violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes.1276 The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One), three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and \u0141bank fraud (Count Two), and five defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight).

Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One conspiracy, entered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to dismiss the charge on multiple grounds.

By early 2017, several congressional committees were examining Russia\u0027s interference in the election. Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017 appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel authorized him to investigate \"the Russian government\u0027s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,\" including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation established that Russia interfere~ in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME I RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference operations identified by the investigation-a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Y evgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled. Pri ozhin is widel re orted to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin In mid-2014, the IRA sent em lo mission with instructions The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system through what it termed \"information warfare.\" The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. The IRA\u0027 s operation also included the purchase \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_21", "label": "par_21", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e of political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office\u0027s investigation of the Russian social media campaign. RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus \u00b7on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government\u0027s role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks. 4 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_22", "label": "par_22", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AH:erHey \\\u00a5Brit Pr6d1:1et // Mtty Cet1:tttifl Mttterittl Preteeted Ut1:der Fed. R. Ct1iffl. P. 6(e) The presidential campaign of Donald J.

Beginning in June 2016, llfilllillliliilfll~llliillllllilllilli forecast to senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information damaging to candidate Clinton. WikiLeaks\u0027s first release came in July 2016.

Section lII of this Report details the Office\u0027s investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails. RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which are summarized below in chronological order. 2015. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate Trump signed a Letter oflntent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian government press secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through at least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump. Spring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russian government \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 16}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_26", "label": "par_26", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton.

The Campaign then distanced itself from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign. July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S. intelligence agencies had \"high confidence\" that the Russian government was.behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC. And within a week of the release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign government rep01ting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel\u0027s Office was a \"backdoor\" way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate Trump\u0027s assent to succeed (were he to be elected President).

A declassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day. Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees-the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)-announced that they would conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Corney later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI\u0027s investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Corney stated: I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\u0027s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u0027s efforts .... As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. The investigation continued under then-Director Corney for the next seven weeks until May 9, 2017, when President Trump fired Corney as FBI Director-an action which is analyzed in Volume II of the rep01t. On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Corney had confirmed in his congressional testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_38", "label": "par_38", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e would serve a substantial federal interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere or through non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27 .220. Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office\u0027s charging decisions, which contain three main components. First, the Office determined that Russia\u0027s two principal interference operations in the 2016 U.S. presidential election-the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers who carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and the have been so char ed. See United States v. Ne ksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215 D.D.C .. Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks\u0027s releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the professor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton .in the form of thousands of emails.

Throughout 2016, IRA accounts published an increasing number of materials supporting the Trump Campaign and opposing the Clinton Campaign. For example, on May 31, 2016, the operational account \"Matt Skiber\" began to privately message dozens of pro-Trump Facebook groups asking them to help plan a \"pro-Trump rally near Trump Tower.\"55 To reach larger U.S. audiences, the IRA purchased advertisements from Facebook that promoted the IRA groups on the newsfeeds of U.S. audience members. According to Facebook, the IRA purchased over 3,500 advertisements, and the expenditures totaled approximately $100,000.56 During the U.S. presidential campaign, many IRA-purchased advertisements explicitly supported or opposed a presidential candidate or promoted U.S. rallies organized by the IRA ( discussed below). As early as March 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements that overtly opposed the Clinton Campaign. For example, on March 18, 2016, the IRA purchased an advertisement depicting candidate Clinton and a caption that read in part, \"If one day God lets this liar enter the White House as a president -that day would be a real national tragedy.\"57 Similarly, on April 6, 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements for its account \"Black Matters\" calling for a \"flashmob\" of U.S. persons to \"take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or #nohillary2016.\"58 IRA-purchased advertisements featuring Clinton were, with very few exceptions, negative.59 IRA-purchased advertisements referencing candidate Trump largely supported his campaign. The first known IRA advertisement explicitly endorsing the Trump Campaign was purchased on April 19, 2016. The IRA bought an advertisement for its Instagram account \"Tea Party News\" asking U.S. persons to help them \"make a patriotic team of young Trump supporters\" by uploading photos with the hashtag \"#KIDS4TRUMP.\"60 In subsequent months, the IRA purchased dozens of advertisements supporting the Trump Campaign, predominantly through the Facebook groups \"Being Patriotic,\" \"Stop All Invaders,\" and \"Secured Borders.\" 55 5/31/16 Facebook Message, ID 100009922908461 (Matt Skiber) to ID 5/31/16 Facebook Message, ID 100009922908461 (Matt Skiber) to ID 56 Social Media Influence in the 2016 US.

RUSSIAN HACKING AND DUMPING OPERATIONS Beginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation\u0027s Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) hacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, e\u00b7mployees, and volunteers supporting the Clinton Campaign, including the email account of campaign chairman John Podesta. Starting in April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU targeted hundreds of email accounts used by Clinton Campaign employees, advisors, and volunteers. In total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks.109 The GRU later released stolen Clinton Campaign and DNC documents through online personas, \"\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_91", "label": "par_91", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0,\" and later through the organization WikiLeaks. The release of the documents was designed and timed to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign. , the Trump Campaign about WikiLeaks\u0027s activities. The investigation was unable to resolve WikiLeaks\u0027s release of the stolen Podesta emails on October 7, 2016, the same day a video from years earlier was published of Trump using graphic language about women. A. GRU Hacking Directed at the Clinton Campaign 1. GRU Units Target the Clinton Campaign Two military units of the GRU carried out the computer intrusions into the Clinton Campaign, DNC, and DCCC: Military Units 26165 and 74455.110 Military Unit 26165 is a GRU cyber unit dedicated to targeting military, political, governmental, and non-governmental organizations outside of Russia, including in the United States.111 The unit was sub-divided into departments with different specialties. One department, for example, developed specialized malicious software \"malware\" , while another de artment conducted large-scale spearphishing campaigns.112 jfllllililliliilllilli lilillllll~ a bitcoin mining operation to 109 As discussed in Section V below, our Office charged 12 GRU officers for crimes arising from the hacking of these computers, principally with conspiring to commit computer intrusions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030 and 371.

R. Cril\u0027l\u0027I. P. 6(e) Unit 26165 officers appear to have stolen thousands of emails and attachments, which were later released by WikiLeaks in July 2016.136 B. Dissemination of the Hacked Materials The GRU\u0027s operations extended beyond stealing materials, and included releasing documents stolen from the Clinton Campaign and its supporters. The GRU carried out the anonymous release through two fictitious online personas that it created-DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0-and later through the organization WikiLeaks. 1. DCLeaks The GRU began planning the releases at least as early as April 19, 2016, when Unit 26165 registered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant.137 Unit 26165 paid for the registration using a pool of bitcoin that it had mined. 138 The dcleaks.com landing page pointed to different tranches of stolen documents, arranged by victim or subject matter. Other dcleaks.com pages contained indexes of the stolen emails that were being released (bearing the sender, recipient, and date of the email). To control access and the timing of releases, pages were sometimes password-protected for a period of time and later made unrestricted to the public. Starting in June 2016, the GRU posted stolen documents onto the website dcleaks.com, including documents stolen from a number of individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign. These documents appeared to have originated from personal email accounts (in particular, Google and Microsoft accounts), rather than the DNC and DCCC computer networks. DCLeaks victims included an advisor to the Clinton Campaign, a former DNC employee and Clinton Campaign employee, and four other campaign volunteers.139 The GRU released through dcleaks.com thousands of documents, including personal identifying and financial information, internal correspondence related to the Clinton Campaign and prior political jobs, and fundraising files and information.140 136 Netyksho Indictment ,i 29.

Specifically, on June 27, 2016, Guccifer 2.0 sent an email to the news outlet The Smoking Gun offering to provide \"exclusive access to some leaked emails linked [to] Hillary Clinton\u0027s staff.\"148 The GRU later sent the reporter a password and link to a locked portion of the dcleaks.com website that contained an archive of emails stolen by Unit 26165 from a Clinton Campaign volunteer in March 2016.149 That the Guccifer 2.0 persona provided reporters access to a restricted portion of the DCLeaks website tends to indicate that both personas were operated by the same or a closely-related group of people.1so The GRU continued its release efforts through Guccifer 2.0 into August 2016. For example, on August 15, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a candidate for the U.S. Congress documents related to the candidate\u0027s opponent.1st On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona transferred approximately 2.5 gigabytes of Florida-related data stolen from the DCCC to a U.S. blogger covering Florida politics.1s2 On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a U.S. reporter documents stolen from the DCCC pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement.1s3 147 Releases of documents on the Guccifer 2.0 blog occurred on June 15, 2016; June 20, 2016; June 21, 2016; July 6, 2016; July 14, 2016; August 12, 2016; August 15, 2016; August 21, 2016; August 31, 2016; September 15, 2016; September 23, 2016; October 4, 2016; and October 18, 2016. ~~ccifer20@aol.fr to 149 6/27/16 Email, uccifer20@aol.fr to ; see also 612 7 /16 (subject \"leaked emails\"); project\").

WikiLeaks\u0027s Expressed Opposition Toward the Clinton Campaign WikiLeaks, and particularly its founder Julian Assange, privately expressed opposition to candidate Clinton well before the first release of stolen documents. In November 2015, Assange wrote to other members and associates of WikiLeaks that \"[w]e believe it would be much better for GOP to win ...

The GRU\u0027s Transfer of Stolen Materials to WikiLeaks Both the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications, which has limited the Office\u0027s ability to collect all of the communications between them. Thus, although it is clear that the stolen DNC and Podesta documents were transferred from the GRU to WikiLeaks, -Investigative Technique 158 3/14/16 Twitter DM, @WikiLeaks to Less than two weeks earlier, the same account had been used to send a private message opposing the idea of Clinton \"in whitehouse with her bloodlutt and amitions [sic] of empire with hawkish liberal-interventionist appointees.\" 11/19/15 Twitter Group Chat, Group ID 594242937858486276, @WikiLeaks et al. 159 6/14/16 Twitter DM, @dcleaks_ to @WikiLeaks. 160 Netyksho Indictment ,r 47(a). 1617/6/16 Twitter DMs, @\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_122", "label": "par_122", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atton=iey Work Protl1:1et // Mtl:y Cottt:tl:ifl Mtl:teritl:l Proteetetl UAtier Fetl.

In total, WikiLeaks released 33 tranches of stolen emails between October 7, 2016 and November 7, 2016. The releases included private speeches given by Clinton; 177 internal communications between Podesta and other high-ranking members of the Clinton Campaign; 178 and correspondence related to the Clinton Foundation.179 In total, WikiLeaks released over 50,000 documents stolen from Podesta\u0027s personal email account. The last-in-time email released from Podesta\u0027 s account was dated March 21, 2016, two days after Podesta received a spearphishing email sent by the GRU. d. WikiLeaks Statements Dissembling About the Source of Stolen Materials As reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged, WikiLeaks and Assange made several public statements apparently designed to obscure the source of the materials that WikiLeaks was r\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_126", "label": "par_126", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attort1ey Work Prndttet ,\u0027/ May Cot1:tait1: Material Proteeted Ut1:der Fed.

But it is a very serious matter ... that type of allegation is very serious, as it\u0027s taken very seriously by us.\"181 After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking. According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. congressman that the DNC hack was an \"inside job,\" and purported to have \"physical proof\u0027 that Russians did not give materials to Assange. 182 C. Additional GRU Cyber Operations While releasing the stolen emails and documents through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and WikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hack victims linked to the Democratic campaign and, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in several states. 1. Summer and Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims On July 27 2016, Unit 26165 targeted email accounts connected to candidate Clinton\u0027s personal office . Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that included the following: \"Russia, if you\u0027re listening, I hope you\u0027re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\"183 The \"30,000 emails\" were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored on a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State. Within approximately five hours of Trump\u0027s statement, GRU officers targeted for the first time Clinton\u0027s personal office. After candidate Trump\u0027s remarks, Unit 26165 created and sent malicious links targeting 15 email accounts at the domain including an email account belonging to Clinton aide The investigation did not find evidence of earlier GRU attempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain. It is unclear how the GRU was able to identify these email accounts, which were not public.184 Unit 26165 officers also hacked into a DNC account hosted on a cloud-computing service copies of the DNC da databases (referred to On September 20, 2016, the GRU began to generate function designed to allow users to produce backups of as \"snapshots\").

The GRU stole approximately 300 gigabytes of data from the DNC based account.185 2. Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. 186 The GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.187 The GRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity. By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental entities. GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a technique known as \"SQL injection,\" by which malicious code was sent to the state or local website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents).188 In one instance in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE\u0027s website. The GRU then gained access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters, 189 and extracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified.190 GRU officers Investigative Technique scanned state and local websites for eriod in July 2016, GRU officers -for vulnerabilities on websites of more than 185 Netyksho Indictment ,i 34; see also SM-2589105-HACK, serial 29 -\u00b7 Investigative Technique 186 Netyksho Indictment ,i 69. 188 Investigative Technique -50 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_138", "label": "par_138", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AM:erttey Wer:k Predttet // Mtty Cetttaitt Mttterial Preteeted Uttder FeE:I.

The investigation did not find evidence that the Trump Campaign recovered any s~ch Clinton emails, or that these contacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign. a. Henry Oknyansky (a/k/a Henry Greenberg) In the spring of 2016, Trump Campaign advisor Michael Caputo learned through a based Russian business partner that another Florida-based Russian, Henry Oknyansky (who also went by the name Henry Greenberg), claimed to have information pertaining to Hillary Clinton. Caputo notified Roger Stone and brokered communication between Stone and Oknyansky. Oknyansky and Stone set up a May 2016 in-person meeting.260 Oknyansky was accompanied to the meeting by Alexei Rasin, a Ukrainian associate involved in Florida real estate. At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information on Clinton that Rasin claimed to have obtained while working for Clinton. Rasin claimed to possess financial statements demonstrating Clinton\u0027s involvement in money laundering with Rasin\u0027s companies. According to Oknyansky, Stone asked if the amounts in question totaled millions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands. Stone refused the offer, stating that Trump would not pay for opposition research.261 Oknyansky claimed to the Office that Rasin\u0027s motivation was financial. According to Oknyansky, Rasin had tried unsuccessfully to shop the Clinton information around to other interested parties, and Oknyansky would receive a cut if the information was sold.262 Rasin is noted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a number of Florida companies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton.

Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails After candidate Trump stated on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would \"find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaign to find the deleted Clinton emails.264 Michael Flynn-who would later serve as National Security Advisor in the Trump Administration-recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly, and Flynn subsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails.265 Barbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn. Ledeen, a long-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn about her efforts throughout the summer of 2016.266 Smith, an investment advisor who was active in Republican politics, also attempted to locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails.267 Ledeen began her efforts to obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn\u0027s request, as early as December 2015.268 On December 3, 2015, she emailed Smith a proposal to obtain the emails, stating, \"Here is the proposal I briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be happy to talk with you either in person or over the phone. The person can get the emails which 1. Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies. That would demonstrate what needs to be demonstrated.\"269 Attached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the \"Clinton email server was, in all likelihood, breached long ago,\" and that the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services could \"re-assemble the server\u0027s email content.\"270 The proposal called for \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 14}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_148", "label": "par_148", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e a three-phase approach. The first two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with certain intelligence sources \"that have access through liaison work with various foreign services\" to determine if any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted, \"Even if a single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would be catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]\" Smith forwarded the email to two colleagues and 264 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 5-6; Flynn 5/1/18 302, at 1-3. 265 Flynn 5/1/18 302, at l-3. 266 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 7; Flynn 5/4/18 302, at 1-2; Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7-8. 267 Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7. 268 Szobocsan 3/29/17 302, at 1. 269 12/3/15 Email, Ledeen to Smith. 270 12/3/15 Email, Ledeen to Smith (attachment). 62 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_149", "label": "par_149", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atlertte~\u0141 \\\\\u0027erk Predttet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteetet:I Uttt:ler Fed.

He created a company, raised tens of thousands of dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others involved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers with \"ties and affiliations to Russia\" who had access to the emails, and that his efforts were coordinated with the Trump Campaign.273 On August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject \"Sec. Clinton\u0027s unsecured private email server\" to an undisclosed list ofrecipients, including Campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. The email stated that Smith was \"u]ust finishing two days of sensitive meetings here in DC with involved groups to poke and probe on the above. It is clear that the Clinton\u0027s home-based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players, and private mercenaries. Parties with varying interests, are circling to release ahead of the election.\"274 On September 2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KLS Research LLC in furtherance of his search for the deleted Clinton emails.275 One of the purposes ofKLS Research was to manage the funds Smith raised in support of his initiative.276 KLS Research received over $30,000 during the presidential campaign, although Smith represented that he raised even more money.277 Smith recruited multiple people for his initiative, including security experts to search for and authenticate the emails.278 In early September 2016, as pait of his recruitment and fundraising effort, Smith circulated a document stating that his initiative was \"in coordination\" with the Trump Campaign, \"to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure organization.\"279 The document listed multiple \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_151", "label": "par_151", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AM:at\u0027t=tey Wark Pra\u003c:ittet // Moy CaHtoiH Material Prnteete\u003c:i Ul\u0027l:\u003c:ier Fee.

In September 2016, Smith and Ledeen got back in touch with each other about their respective efforts. Ledeen wrote to Smith, \"wondering if you had some more detailed reports or memos or other data you could share because we have come a long way in our efforts since we last visited .... We would need as much technical discussion as possible so we could marry it against the new data we have found and then could share it back to you \u0027your eyes only.\u0027\"282 Ledeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the \"dark web\") that purpo1ted to be the deleted Clinton emails.

Erik Prince provided funding to hire a tech advisor to ascertain the authenticity of the emails. According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that the emails were not authentic.283 A backup of Smith\u0027s computer contained two files that had been downloaded from WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. The files on Smith\u0027s computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect when the files were downloaded to Smith\u0027s computer. (It appears the creation date was when WikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section III.B.3.c, supra.284) The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their release by WikiLeaks.

See Volume I, Section 111.B.3.c, supra. The Office tested this theory in March 2019 by downloading the two files found on Smith\u0027s computer from WikiLeaks\u0027s site using the same Apple operating system on Smith\u0027s computer; both files were successfully downloaded and retained the October 2, 2016 creation date.

One week later, on May 6, 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to candidate Clinton. Papadopoulos shared information about Russian \"dirt\" with people outside of the Campaign, and the Office investigated whether he also provided it to a Campaign official. Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom he interacted told the Office that they did \u00b7 not recall that Papadopoulos passed them the information. Throughout the relevant period of time and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. That meeting never came to pass. a. Origins of Campaign Work In March 2016, Papadopoulos became a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.395 As early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign but, in a September 30, 2015 email, he was told that the Campaign was not hiring policy advisors.396 In late 2015, Papadopoulos obtained a paid position on the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. 397 Although Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 20 I 6, Papadopoulos had stopped actively working for his campaign by early February 2016.398 At that time, Papadopoulos reached out to a contact at the London Centre of International Law Practice (LCILP), which billed itself as a \"unique institution . . . \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 11}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_200", "label": "par_200", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterttey Werk Predtiet // Ma:,1 Cel\u0027l:tail\u0027I: Material Preteeted 01\u00271:der Fed.

Papadopoulos and Campaign advisor J.D. Gordon-who told investigators in an interview that he had a \"crystal clear\" recollection of the meeting-have stated that Trump was interested in and receptive to the idea of a meeting with Putin.438 Papadopoulos understood Sessions to be similarly supportive of his efforts to arrange a meeting.439 Gordon and two other attendees, however, recall that Sessions generally opposed the proposal, though they differ in their accounts of the concerns he voiced or the strength of the opposition he expressed.440 d.

Such disclosures raised questions about whether Papadopoulos informed any Trump Campaign official about the emails. When interviewed, Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials who interacted with him told the Office that they could not recall Papadopoulos\u0027s sharing the information that Russia had obtained \"dirt\" on candidate Clinton in the form of emails or that Russia could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information about Clinton. Papadopoulos stated that he could not clearly recall having told anyone on the Campaign and wavered about whether he accurately remembered an incident in which Clovis had been upset after hearing Papadopoulos tell Clovis that Papadopoulos thought \"they have her emails.\"495 The Campaign officials who interacted or corresponded with Papadopoulos have similarly stated, with varying degrees of certainty, that he did not tell them. Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, for example, did not remember hearing anything from Papadopoulos or Clovis about Russia having emails of or dirt on candidate Clinton.496 Clovis stated that he did not recall anyone, including Papadopoulos, having given him non-public information that a forei n overnment mi ht be in ossession of material dama in to Hillar Clinton.497 492 George Papadopoulos: Sanctions Have Done Little More Than to Turn Russia Towards China, Interfax (Sept. 30, 2016). 493 Papadopoulos 9/19/17 302, at 14-15; Def.

According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of learning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he was made aware of the meeting--or its Russian connection-before it occurred. The Russian attorney who spoke at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had previously worked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout this period of time. She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but Veselnitskaya did not provide such information. She and her associates then turned to a critique of the origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on Russian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr. suggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected. After the election, Veselnitskaya made additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump Transition Team did not engage. a. Setting Up the June 9 Meeting i.

We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the June 9 meeting. On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give \"a major speech\" \"probably Monday of next week\"-which would have been June 13-about \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.\" See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, Washington Post (Aug. 7, 2018). Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changed the subject of his planned speech to national security. But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was connected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that meeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton. Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, could well have caused the change. The President\u0027s written answers to our questions state that the speech\u0027s focus was altered \u0027\u0027[i]n light of\u0027 the Pulse nightclub shooting. See Written Responses, supra. As for the original topic of the June 13 speech, Trump has said that \"he expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative inf01mation about the Clintons,\" and that the draft of the speech prepared by Campaign staff\"was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.\" Written Responses, supra. In a later June 22 speech, Trump did speak extensively about allegations that Clinton was corrupt, drawing from the Clinton Cash book.

In a July 2017 press interview, Veselnitskaya claimed that she has no connection to the Russian government and had not referred to any derogatory information concerning the Clinton Campaign when she met with Trump Campaign officials.737 Veselnitskaya\u0027s November 2017 written submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that the purpose of the June 9 meeting was not to connect with \"the Trump Campaign\" but rather to have \"a private meeting with Donald Trump Jr.-a friend of my good acquaintance\u0027s son on the matter of assisting me or my colleagues in informing the Congress members as to the criminal nature of manipulation and interference with the legislative activities of the US Congress.\"738 In other words, Veselnitskaya claimed her focus was on Congress and not the Campaign. No witness, however, recalled any reference to Congress during the meeting. Veselnitskaya also maintained that she \"attended the meeting as a lawyer of Denis Katsyv,\" the pr,eviously mentioned owner of Prevezon Holdings, but she did not \"introduce [her]self in this capacity.\"739 In a July 2017 television interview, Trump Jr. stated that while he had no way to gauge the reliability, credibility, or accuracy of what Goldstone had stated was the purpose of the meeting, if \"someone has information on our opponent ... maybe this is something. I should hear them out.\"740 Trump Jr. fu1ther stated in September 2017 congressional testimony that he thought he should \"listen to what Rob and his colleagues had to say.\"741 Depending on what, if any, information was provided, Trump Jr. stated he could then \"consult with counsel to make an informed decision as to whether to give it any further consideration.\"742 735 NOSC00003992 (6/9/16 Text Message, Kushner to Manafort); Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 9; Vargas 4/4/18 302, at 7; NOSC00000044 (6/9/16 Email, Kushner to Vargas); NOSC00000045 (6/9/16 Email, Kushner to Cain). 736 Samochornov 7 /12/17 302, at 4; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 9-10; see also Interview of Donald J Trump, Jr., Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong. 48-49 (Sept. 7, 2017). . 737 Russian Lawyer Veselnitskaya Says She Didn\u0027t Give Trump Jr. Info on Clinton, NBC News (July 11, 2017). 738 Testimony of Natalia Veselnitskaya before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 115th Cong. }O(Nov 20, 2017). 739 Testimony of Natalia Veselnitskaya before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 115th Cong. 21 (Nov. 20, 2017). 2017). 740 Sean Hannity, Transcript-Donald Trump Jr, Fox News (July 11, 2017). 741 Interview of Donald J Trump, Jr, Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong. 16 (Sept. 7, 2017). 742 Interview of Donald J Trump, Jr, Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong. 16-17 (Sept. 7, 119 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 18}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_293", "label": "par_293", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attoft\u0027le\u0027.y\" Wofk Prodttet // Mfl\u0027)1 Cotttaitt Material Proteeted Uttder Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) Third, according to Gates and what Kilimnik told Patten, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed two sets of financial disputes related to Mana fort\u0027s previous work in the region. Those consisted of the unresolved Deripaska lawsuit and the funds that the Opposition Bloc owed to Manafort for his political consulting work and how Manafort might be able to obtain payment.933 After the meeting, Gates and Manafort both. stated that they left separately from Kilimnik because they knew the media was tracking Manafort and wanted to avoid media reporting on his connections to Kilimnik.934 c. Post-Resignation Activities Manafort resigned from the Trump Campaign in mid-August 2016, approximately two weeks after his second meeting with Kilimnik, amidst negative media reporting about his political consulting work for the pro-Russian Party of Regions in Ukraine. Despite his resignation, Manafort continued to offer advice to various Campaign officials through the November election. Manafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump,935 and some of those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails. For example, on October 21, 2016, Manafort sent Kushner an email and attached a strategy memorandum proposing that the Campaign make the case against Clinton \"as the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment\" and that \"Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very credible way -by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC members.\"936 Later, in a November 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled \"Securing the Victory,\" Manafort stated that he was \"really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory,\" and that he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respond to a loss by \"mov[ing] immediately to discredit the [Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that the Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the results.\"937 Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Manafort told the Office that, in the wake of Trump\u0027s victory, he was not interested in an Administration job. Manafort instead preferred to stay on the \"outside,\" and monetize his campaign position to generate business given his familiarity and relationship with Trump and the incoming Administration.938 Manafort appeared to follow that plan, as he traveled to the Middle East, Cuba, South Korea, Japan, and China and was paid to explain what a Trump presidency would entaii.939 Manafort\u0027 s activities in early 2017 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia.

R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) Although members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S. person with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was speaking with Russian nationals engaged in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore determined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge them in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging a wire-and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Russian nationals (Count Two). The Office did, however, charge one U.S. national for his role in supplying false or stolen bank account numbers that allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems by circumventing those systems\u0027 security features. On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty, pursuant to a single-count information, to identity fraud, in violation of 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) and (b)(l)(D).

The investigation did not establish that Pinedo was aware of the identity of the IRA members who purchased bank account numbers from him. Pinedo\u0027s sales of account numbers enabled the IRA members to anonymously access a financial network through which they transacted with U.S. persons and companies. See Gov\u0027t Sent.

Russian Hacking and Dumping Operations 1. Section 1030 Computer-Intrusion Conspiracy a. Background On July 13, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment charging Russian military intelligence officers from the GRU with conspiring to hack into various U.S. computers used by the Clinton Campaign, DNC, DCCC, and other U.S. persons, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030 and 371 (Count One); committing identity theft and conspiring to commit money laundering in furtherance of that hacking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 I 028A and l 956(h) (Counts Two through Ten); and a separate conspiracy to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities responsible for the administration of the 2016 U.S. election, in violation of18U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030and371 (CountEleven).

R. Criffl. P. e(e) prosecution memorandum submitted to the Acting Attorney General before the original indictment in that case. In addition, the investigation produced evidence of FARA violations involving Michael Flynn. Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (i.e., Turkey) and were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts in the Statement of Offense that accompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge. Statement of Offense, United States v. Michael T Flynn, No. l:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 4 (\"Flynn Statement of Offense\").1281 The investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any individual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof. In particular, the Office did not find evidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian overnrnent-or at its direction control, or re uest-durin the relevant time eriod.1282 As a result, the Office did not charge any other Trump Campaign official with violating FARA or Section 951, or attempting or conspiring to do so, based on contacts with the Russian government or a Russian principal. Finally, the Office investigated whether one of the above campaign advisors-George Papadopoulos-acted as an agent of, or at the direction and control of, the government of Israel. While the investigation revealed significant ties between Papadopoulos and Israel (and search warrants were obtained in part on that basis), the Office ultimately determined that the evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA or Section 951. 3. Campaign Finance Several areas of the Office\u0027s investigation involved efforts or offers by foreign nationals to provide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign or to distribute that information to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign. As explained below, the Office considered whether two of those efforts in particular-the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump 1282 On four occasions, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued warrants based on a finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801 (b ), 1805(a)(2)(A).

On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be interviewed by FBI agents, who informed him that the interview was part of the investigation into potential Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election. During the interview, Papadopoulos lied about the timing, extent, and nature of his communications with Joseph Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya, and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to timing, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians had \"dirt\" on Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails.\" But Papadopoulos stated multiple times that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campaign and that it was a \"very strange coincidence\" to be told of the \"dirt\" before he started working for the Campaign. This account was false. Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March 14, 2016, after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the Campaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos only after learning of his role on the Campaign.

Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with \"an individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have information helpful to the campaign\" and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children. When the press asked questions about the President\u0027s involvement in Trump Jr.\u0027 s statement, the President\u0027s personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any role. Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation. In early summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In October 2017, the President met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him to \"take [a] look\" at investigating Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes taken by a senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia investigation, he would be a \"hero.\" The President told Sessions, \"I\u0027m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.\" In response, Sessions volunteered that he had never seen anything \"improper\" on the campaign and told the President there was a \"whole new leadership team\" in place.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) though McCabe told the President he had worked \"very closely\" with Corney and was part of all the decisions made in the Clinton investigation. b. Nexus to a proceeding. The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing that a grand jury proceeding or criminal prosecution arising from an FBI investigation was objectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated Corney. Several facts would be relevant to such a showing. At.the time the President fired Corney, a grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation and no grand jury subpoenas had been issued. On March 20, 2017, however, Corney had announced that the FBI was investigating Russia\u0027s interference in the election, including \"an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.\" It was widely known that the FBI, as part of the Russia investigation, was investigating the hacking of the DNC\u0027s computers-a clear criminal offense. In addition, at the time the President fired Corney, evidence indicates the President knew that Flynn was still under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted, despite the President\u0027s February 14, 2017 request that Corney \"let[] Flynn go.\" On March 5, 2017, the White House Counsel\u0027s Office was informed that the FBI was asking for transition-period records relating to Flynn-indicating that the FBI was still actively investigating him. The same day, the President told advisors he wanted to call Dana Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation, to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated. On March 31, 2017, the President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in legal jeopardy by tweeting that \"Mike Flynn should ask for immunity\" before he agreed to provide testimony to the FBI or Congress. And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a message to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong, further demonstrating the President\u0027s awareness of Flynn\u0027s criminal exposure. c. Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President\u0027s decision to fire Corney was Corney\u0027s unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally under investigation, despite the President\u0027s repeated requests that Corney make such an announcement. In the week leading up to Corney\u0027s May 3, 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last straw if Corney did not set the record straight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation. But during his May 3 testimony, Corney refused to answer questions about whether the President was being investigated. Corney\u0027s refusal angered the President, who criticized Sessions for leaving him isolated and exposed, saying \"You left me on an island.\" Two days later, the President told advisors he had decided to fire Corney and dictated a letter to Stephen Miller that began with a reference to the fact that the President was not being investigated: \"While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship .... \" The President later asked Rosenstein to include \"Russia\" in his memorandum and to say that Corney had told the President that he was not under investigation. And the President\u0027s final termination letter included a sentence, at the President\u0027s insistence and against McGahn\u0027s advice, stating that Corney had told the President on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. The President\u0027s other stated rationales for why he fired Corney are not similarly supported by the evidence.

R. Crim. P. 6(ej cited Corney\u0027s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired Corney for that reason. But the facts surrounding Corney\u0027s handling of the Clinton email investigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the President had made it clear to both Corney and the President\u0027s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted Corney to stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Corney\u0027s handling of the Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Corney. The President\u0027s draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the press after Corney\u0027s termination that the White House had heard from \"countless\" FBI agents who had lost confidence in Corney. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told Corney at their January 27 dinner that \"the people of the FBI really like [him],\" no evidence suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Corney, and Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything. We also considered why it was important to the President that Corney announce publicly that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Corney that the \"cloud\" of \"this Russia business\" was making it difficult to run the country. The President told Sessions and McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that the perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues. The President complained to Rogers that \"the thing with the Russians [ was] messing up\" his ability to get things done with Russia, and told Coats, \"I can\u0027t do anything with Russia, there\u0027s things I\u0027d like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they\u0027re all over me with this.\" The President also may have viewed Corney as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that the President was not under investigation. Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI\u0027s interview of Flynn, the President had a one-on-one dinner with Corney, against the advice of senior aides, and told Corney he needed Corney\u0027s \"loyalty.\" When the President later asked Corney for a second time to make public that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying \"Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.\" After the President learned of Sessions\u0027s recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney General \"who to investigate.\" In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation behind him. The evidence does not establish that the termination of Corney was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns.

On the morning of Monday, July 24, 2017, the President criticized Sessions for neglecting to investigate Clinton and called him \"beleaguered.\"659 On July 25, the President tweeted, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are mails \u0026 DNC server) \u0026 Intel leakers!\"660 The following day, July 26, the President tweeted, \"Why didn\u0027t A.G.

We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.712 The statement did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton or any discussion of the Magnitsky Act or U.S. sanctions, which were the principal subjects of the meeting, as described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. A short while later, while still on Air Force One, Hicks learned that Priebus knew about the emails, which further convinced her that additional information about the June 9 meeting would leak and the White House should be proactive and get in front of the story.713 Hicks recalled again going to the President to urge him that they should be fully transparent about the June 9 meeting, but he again said no, telling Hicks, \"You\u0027ve given a statement. We\u0027re done.\"714 Later on the flight home, Hicks went to the President\u0027s cabin, where the President was on the phone with one of his personal attorneys.715 At one point the President handed the phone to Hicks, and the attorney told Hicks that he had been working with Circa News on a separate story, and that she should not talk to the New York Times.716 4.

Hope says \u0027only a few people have it. It will never get out.\"\u0027725 Hicks later told investigators that she had no memory of making that comment and had always believed the emails would eventually be leaked, but she might have been channeling the President on the phone call because it was clear to her throughout her conversations with the President that he did not think the emaiis would leak.726 On July 11, 2017, Trump Jr. posted redacted images of the emails setting up the June 9 meeting on Twitter; the New York Times reported that he did so \"[a]fter being told that The Times was about to publish the content of the emails.\"727 Later that day, the media reported that the President had been personally involved in preparing Trump Jr.\u0027s initial statement to the New York Times that had claimed the meeting \"primarily\" concerned \"a program about the adoption of Russian children.\"728 Over the next several days, the President\u0027s personal counsel repeatedly and 719 See Donald Trump Jr. gathered members of campaign/or meeting with Russian lawyer before election, Circa News (July 8, 2017). 720 Hicks 3/ 13/ 18 302, at 8; Corallo 2/ 15/ l 8 302, at 6-7. 721 Corallo 2/15/18 302, at 7. 722 Corallo 2/15/18 302, at 7. 723 Corallo 2/15/18 302, at 7-9. 724 Corallo 2/15/18 302, at 8. 725 Corallo 2/15/18 302, at 8; Corallo 7/9/17 Notes (\"Sunday 9th -Hope calls w/ POTUS on line\").

Later that day, the President rejected Trump Jr. \u0027s draft statement that would have acknowledged that the meeting was with \"an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.\" The President then dictated a statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption (which the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting). The statement dictated by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton.

Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered by his Recusal Later in 2017, the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who would not be recused. On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the Department of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the Department should be investigating.752 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who was at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton\u0027s emails and said, \"Don\u0027t have to tell us, just take [a] look.\"753 Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the Department of Justice would comply with that request. 754 Two days later, on October 18, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Wow, FBI confirms report that James Corney drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete.

(citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (l 988), and Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 115-116 ( 1926)). Consistent with that statement, Morrison sustained a good-cause limitation on the removal of an inferior officer with defined prosecutorial responsibilities after determining that the limitation did not impermissibly undermine the President\u0027s ability to perform his Article II functions. 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696. The Court has also evaluated other general executive-power claims through a balancing test. For example, the Court evaluated the President\u0027s claim of an absolute privilege for presidential communications about his official acts by balancing that interest against the Judicial Branch\u0027s need for evidence in a criminal case. United States v. Nixon, supra (recognizing a qualified constitutional privilege for presidential communications on official matters). The Court has also upheld a law that provided for archival access to presidential records despite a claim of absolute presidential privilege over the records. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443-445, 451-455. The analysis in those cases supports applying a balancing test to assess the constitutionality of applying the obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential exercises of executive power. Only in a few instances has the Court applied a different framework. When the President\u0027s power is \"both \u0027exclusive\u0027 and \u0027conclusive\u0027 on the issue,\" Congress is precluded from regulating its exercise. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, I 35 S. Ct. 2076, 2084 (2015). In Zivotofsky, for example, the Court followed \"Justice Jackson\u0027s familiar tripartite framework\" in Youngstown Sheet \u0026 Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring), and held that the President\u0027s 1087 OLC applied such a balancing test in concluding that the President is not subject to criminal prosecution while in office, relying on many of the same precedents discussed in this section. See A Sitting President\u0027s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222, 237-238, 244-245 (2000) (relying on, inter alia, United States v. Nixon, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and Clinton v. Jones, and quoting the legal standard from Administrator of General Services v. Nixon that is applied in the text). OLC recognized that \"[t]he balancing analysis\" it had initially relied on in finding that a sitting President is immune from prosecution had \"been adopted as the appropriate mode of analysis by the Court.\" Id. at 244. 172 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_807", "label": "par_807", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterr,e, Werk Preettet // May Cer,tair, Material Preteetee UAeer Fee.

The Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack took place in the early morning hours of Sunday, June 12, 2016. In light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed more specifically to national security and terrorism than to the Clintons. That speech was delivered at the Saint Anselm College Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following: This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be. Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president. There will be plenty of oppo1tunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon. But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.

R. Crim.. P. 6(e) b. Communications with J.C. Expert Investment Company and Giorgi Rtskhiladze (Summer and Fall 2015) In the late summer of 2015, the Trump Organization received a new inquiry about pursuing a Trump Tower project in Moscow. In approximately September 2015, Felix Sater, a New based real estate advisor, contacted Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.304 Sater had previously worked with the Trump Organization and advised it on a number of domestic and international projects. Sater had explored the possibility of a Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the Trump Organization and therefore knew of the organization\u0027s general interest in completing a deal there.305 Sater had also served as an informal agent of the Trump Organization in Moscow previously and had accompanied lvanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to Moscow in the mid-2000s.306 Sater contacted Cohen on behalf of I.C. Expert Investment Company (LC. Expert), a Russian real-estate development corporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov.307 Sater had known Rozov since approximately 2007 and, in 2014, had served as an agent on behalf of Rozov during Rozov\u0027s purchase of a building in New York City.308 Sater later contacted Rozov and proposed that I.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscow project in which l.C. Expert would license the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its own. Sater worked on the deal with Rozov and another.employee of l.C. Expert.309 Cohen was the only Trump Organization representative to negotiate directly with l.C. Expert or its agents. In approximately September 2015, Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with I.C. Expert from candidate Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization. Cohen provided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016, assuring him the project was continuing.31\u00b0 Cohen also discussed the Trump Moscow project with Ivanka Trump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project311) and Donald J. Trump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project312) during the fall of 2015. . rovided information to our Office in two 2017 interviews conducted under a proffer agreement 306 Sater9/19/17 302, at 1-2, 5. 307 Sater 9/19/17 302, a\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 11}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_166", "label": "par_166", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Att:erftey Werk Preattet // Mlt)1 Cefttttift Material Preteetea UH:aer Fed.

P. 6(e) Also during the fall of 2015, Cohen communicated about the Trump Moscow proposal with Giorgi Rtskhiladze, a business executive who previously had been involved in a development deal with the Trump Organization in Batumi, Georgia.313 Cohen stated that he spoke to Rtskhiladze in part because Rtskhiladze had pursued business ventures in Moscow, including a licensing deal with the Agalarov-owned Crocus Group.314 On September 22, 2015, Cohen forwarded a preliminary design study for the Trump Moscow project to Rtskhiladze, adding \"I look forward to your reply about this spectacular project in Moscow.\" Rtskhiladze forwarded Cohen\u0027s email to an associate and wrote, \"[i]f we could organize the meeting in New York at the highest level of the Russian Government and Mr. Trump this project would definitely receive the worldwide attention.\"315 On September 24, 2015, Rtskhiladze sent Cohen an attachment that he described as a proposed \"[!Jetter to the Mayor of Moscow from Trump org,\" explaining that \"[ w ]e need to send this letter to the Mayor of Moscow (second guy \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 11}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_468", "label": "par_468", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e /15/ 17 302, at 3. 112 Corney 1/7/17 Memorandum, at 1-2; Corney I 1/15/17 302, at 3.

No meeting took place. Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President. On June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described as \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.\" The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as \"part of Russia and its government\u0027s support for Mr. Trump.\" The written communications setting up the meeting showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump\u0027s electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer\u0027s presentation did not provide such information. Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the DNC announced that Russian government \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_29", "label": "par_29", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e hackers had infiltrated the DNC and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents.

Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting. Fall 2016. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy. Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John Podesta\u0027s emails that had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. government institutions were at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere in the presidential election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement \"that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\" Those \"thefts\" and the \"disclosures\" of the hacked materials through online platforms such as WikiLeaks, the statement continued, \"are intended to interfere with the US election process.\" Post-2016 Election. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there. Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund, was among the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December, a business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations. During the same period, another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served on the Campaign or the Transition Team. Dmitriev and Kushner\u0027s friend collaborated on a short written reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been cleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted, \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin).\" The next day, on December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result of Flynn\u0027s request. * * * \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_35", "label": "par_35", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the investigation. President Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel\u0027s appointment. He told advisors that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it, including through public and private contacts with potential witnesses.

For example, the investigation established that interactions between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate\u0027s April 2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that one Campaign official\u0027s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions\u0027s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign. The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office\u0027s judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Depa11ment of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual\u00a7\u00a7 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter ( or \"taint\") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_46", "label": "par_46", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.\" 28 C.F.R: \u00a7 600.6. Like a U.S. Attorney\u0027s Office, the Special Counsel\u0027s Office considered a range of classified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office\u0027s Russia investigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution).

The Special Counsel\u0027s Office exercised its judgment regarding what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a contact between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and entities. The Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain proceedings associated with the Office\u0027s work remain ongoing. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to other components of the Department of Justice and FBI. Appendix D lists those transfers. Two district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel\u0027s authority to investigate Russia election interference and links and/or coordination with the Trump Campaign. See United States v. Manafort, 312 F. Supp. 3d 60, 79-83 (D.D.C. 2018); United States v. Manafort, 321 F. Supp. 3d 640, 650-655 (E.D. Va. 2018).

The IRA\u0027s contacts included requests for signs and other materials to use at rallies, 107 as well as requests to promote the rallies and help coordinate Iogistics.108 While certain campaign volunteers agreed to provide the requested support (for example, agreeing to set aside a number of signs), the investigation has not identified evidence that any Trump Campaign official understood the requests were coming from foreign nationals. * * * In sum, the investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election through the \"active measures\" social media campaign carried out by the IRA, an organization funded by Prigozhin and companies that he controlled.

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS To AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN The Office identified multiple contacts-\"links,\" in the words of the Appointment between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The Office investigated whether those contacts constituted a third avenue of attempted Russian interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election. In particular, the investigation examined whether these contacts involved or resulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the Trump Campaign and Russia, including with respect to Russia providing assistance to the Campaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future. Based on the available information, the investigation did not establish such coordination. This Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals with ties to the Russian government, including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates that have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts. Each subsection begins with an overview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are generally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and extending through the post-election, transition period. A. Campaign Period (September 2015 -November 8, 2016) Russian-government-connected individuals and media entities began showing interest in Trump\u0027s campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015.288 Because Trump\u0027s status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and entertainment dealings, this Office investigated whether a business contact with Russia-linked individuals and entities during the campaign period-the Trump Tower Moscow project, see Volume l, Section IV.A. I, infra-led to or involved coordination of election assistance.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) 1. Trump Tower Moscow Project The Trump Organization has pursued and completed projects outside the United States as part of its real estate portfolio. Some projects have involved the acquisition and ownership (through subsidiary corporate structures) of property. In other cases, the Trump Organization has executed licensing deals with real estate developers and management companies, often local to the country where the project was located.289 Between at least 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similar licensing deal in Russia involving the construction of a Trump-branded property in Moscow. The project, commonly referred to as a \"Trump Tower Moscow\" or \"Trump Moscow\" project, anticipated a combination of commercial, hotel, and residential properties all within the same building. Between 2013 and June 2016, several employees of the Trump Organization, including president of the organization Donald J. Trump, pursued a Moscow deal with several Russian counterparties. From the fall of 2015 until the middle of 2016, Michael Cohen spearheaded the Trump Organization\u0027s pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project, including by reporting on the project\u0027s status to candidate Trump and other executives in the Trump Organization.290 a. Trump Tower Moscow Venture with the Crocus Group (2013-2014) The Trump Organization and the Crocus Group, a Russian real estate conglomerate owned and controlled by Aras Agalarov, began discussing a Russia-based real estate project shortly after the conclusion of the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.291 Donald J. Trump Jr. served as _the primary negotiator on behalf of the Trump Organization; Emin Agalarov (son of Aras Agalarov) and Irakli \"Ike\" Kaveladze represented the Crocus Group during negotiations,292 with the occasional assistance of Robe1t Goldstone.293 In December 2013, Kaveladze and Trump Jr. negotiated and signed preliminary terms of 289 See, e.g., Interview of Donald J Trump, Jr, Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong. 151-52 (Sept. 7, 2017) ( discussing licensing deals of specific projects). 290 As noted in Volume I, Section III.D.l, supra, in November 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress concerning, among other things, the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow project. See Information ,r 7(a), United States v. Michael Cohen, 1 :18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y.

As has been widely reported, the Miss Universe pageant-which Trump co-owned_at the time-was held at the Agalarov-owned Crocus City Hall in Moscow in November 2013. Both groups were involved in organizing the pageant, and Aras Agalarov\u0027s son Emin was a musical performer at the event, which Trump attended. 292 Kaveladze 11/16/17 302, at 2, 4-6; OSC-KA V _00385 (12/6/13 Email, Trump Jr. to Kaveladze \u0026 E.

Michael lets go. 2 boys from Brooklyn getting a USA president elected. This is good really good.328 According to Cohen, he did not consider the political import of the Trump Moscow project to the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the time. Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or anyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump Moscow project with him. However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the candidate suggested that his campaign would be a significant \"infomercial\" for Trump-branded prope1ties. 329 ii. Post-LOI Contacts with Individuals in Russia Given the size of the Trump Moscow project, Sater and Cohen believed the project required approval (whether express or implicit) from the Russian national government, including from the Presidential Administration of Russia.330 Sater stated that he therefore began to contact the Presidential Administration through another Russian business contact.331 In early negotiations with the Trump Organization, Sater had alluded to the need for government approval and his attempts to set up meetings with Russian officials. On October 12, 2015, for example, Sater wrote to Cohen that \"all we need is Putin on board and we are golden,\" and that a \"meeting with Putin and top deputy is tentatively set for the 14th [ of October]. \"332 this meeting was being coordinated by associates in Russia and that he had no direct interaction with the Russian government. 333 Approximately a month later, after the LOI had been signed, Lana Erchova emailed lvanka Trump on behalf of Erchova\u0027s then-husband Dmitry Klokov, to offer Klokov\u0027s assistance to the Trump Campaign.334 Klokov was at that time Director of External Communications for PJSC Federal Grid Company of Unified Energy System, a large Russian electricity transmission 328 11/3/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12:40 p.m.). 329 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 3-4; Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 15. 330 Sater 12/15/17 302, at 2. 331 Sater 12/15/17 302, at 3-4. 332 10/12/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (8:07 a.m.). 333 334 Ivanka Trump received an email from a woman who identified herself as \"Lana E.

Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen.335 He told the Office that, after receiving this inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov\u0027s name and concluded (incorrectly) that Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter.336 Between November 18 and 19, 2015,-Klokov and Cohen had at least one telephone call and exchanged several emails. Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a \"trusted person\" who could offer the Campaign \"political synergy\" and \"synergy on a government level,\" Klokov recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary. Klokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the candidate and an individual Klokov described as \"our person of interest.\"337 In an email to the Office, Erchova later identified the \"person of interest\" as Russian President Vladimir Putin. 338 In the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local developers. Cohen registered his willingness also to meet with Klokov and the unidentified intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate including a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin-would need to be \"in conjunction with the development and an official visit\" with the Trump Organization receiving a formal invitation to visit.339 (Klokov had written previously that \"the visit [by candidate Trump to Russia] has to be informal.\")340 Klokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over a possible meeting between Trump and \"the person of interest\" from any existing business track. 341 Re-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second email to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have \"phenomenal\" impact \"in a business dimension\" and that the \"person of interest[\u0027s]\" \"most important support\" could have significant ramifications for the \"level of projects and their capacity.\" Klokov concluded by telling 335 11/16/15 Email, I.

Cohen explained that he did not pursue the proposed meeting because he was already working on the Moscow Project with Sater, who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.344 By late December 2015, however, Cohen was complaining that Sater had not been able to use those connections to set up the promised meeting with Russian government officials. Cohen told Sater that he was \"setting up the meeting myself. \"345 On January 11, 2016, Cohen emailed the office of Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government\u0027s press secretary, indicating that he desired contact with Sergei Ivanov, Putin\u0027s chief of staff. Cohen erroneously used the email address \"Pr_peskova@prpress.gof.ru\" instead of \"Pr _peskova@prpress.gov .ru,\" so the email apparently did not go through.346 On January 14, 2016, Cohen emailed a different address (info@prpress.gov.ru) with the following message: Dear Mr. Peskov, Over the past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City. Without getting into lengthy specifics, the communication between our two sides has stalled. As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance. I respectfully request someone, preferably you; contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.347 Two days later, Cohen sent an email to Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru, repeating his request to speak with Sergei Ivanov.348 Cohen testified to Congress, and initially told the Office, that he did not recall receiving a response to this email inquiry and that he decided to terminate any further work on the Trump Moscow project as of January 2016.

P. 6Ee) fact, Cohen had received (and recalled receiving) a response to his inquiry, and he continued to work on and update candidate Trump on the project through as late as June 2016.349 On January 20, 2016, Cohen received an email from Elena Poliakova, Peskov\u0027s personal assistant. Writing from her personal email account, Poliakova stated that she had been trying to reach Cohen and asked that he call her on the personal number that she provided.350 Shortly after receiving Poliakova\u0027s email, Cohen called and spoke to her for 20 minutes.351 Cohen described to Poliakova his position at the Trump Organization and outlined the proposed Trump Moscow project, including information about the Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization had partnered. Cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to build the project and with financing. According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed questions and took notes, stating that she would need to follow up with others in Russia.352 Cohen could not recall any direct follow-up from Poliakova or from any other representative of the Russian government, nor did the Office identify any evidence of direct follow-up. However, the day after Cohen\u0027s call with Poliakova, Sater texted Cohen, asking him to \"[c]all me when you have a few minutes to chat ... It\u0027s about Putin they called today.\"353 Sater then sent a draft invitation for Cohen to visit Moscow to discuss the Trump Moscow project, 354 along with a note to \"[t]ell me if the letter is good as amended by me or make whatever changes you want and send it back to me.\"355 After a further round of edits, on January 25, 2016, Sater sent Cohen an invitation-signed by Andrey Ryabinskiy of the company MHJ-to travel to \"Moscow for a working visit\" about the \"prospects of development and the construction business in Russia,\" \"the various land plots available suited for construction of this enormous Tower,\" and \"the oppo1tunity to co-ordinate a follow up visit to Moscow by Mr. Donald Trump.\"356 According 349 Cohen Information ,i,i 4, 7.

Discussions about Russia Travel by Michael Cohen or Candidate Trump (December 2015-June 2016) i. Sater \u0027s Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia The late January communication was neither the first nor the last time that Cohen contemplated visiting Russia in pursuit of the Trump Moscow project. Beginning in late 2015, Sater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump Organization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing partners. In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for traveling to Russia for meetings.358 On December 19, 2015, Sater wrote: Please call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line. [359] He needs a copy of your and Donald\u0027s passports they need a scan of every page of the passports. Invitations \u0026 Visas will be issued this week by VTB Bank to discuss financing for Trump Tower Moscow. Politically neither Putins office nor Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot issue invite, so they are inviting commercially/ business. VTB is Russia\u0027s 2 biggest bank and VTB Bank CEO Andrey Kostin, will be at all meetings with Putin so that it is a business meeting not political. We will be invited to Russian consulate this week to receive invite \u0026 have visa issued.360 In response, Cohen texted Sater an image of his own passport.361 Cohen told the Office that at one point he requested a copy of candidate Trump\u0027s passport from Rhona Graff, Trump\u0027s executive assistant at the Trump Organization, and that Graff later brought Trump\u0027s passport to Cohen\u0027s 357 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 6-7. 358 See, e.g., 12/1/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12:41 p.m.) (\"Please scan and send me a copy of your passport for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"). 359 Toll records show that Sater was speaking to Evgeny Dvoskin. Call Records of Felix Sater Dvoskin is an executive of Genbank, a large bank with lending focused in Crimea, Ukraine. At the time that Sater provided this financing letter to Cohen, Genbank was subject to U.S. government sanctions, see Russia/Ukraine-related Sanctions and Identifications, Office of Foreign Assets Control (Dec. 22, 2015), available at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAEnforcement/Pages/20151222.aspx. Dvoskin, who had been deported from the United States in 2000 for criminal activity, was under indictment in the United States for stock fraud under the aliases Eugene Slusker and Gene Shustar.

Let me know about If I was right by saying I believe after Cleveland and also when you want to speak to them and possibly fly over.365 Cohen responded, \"My trip before Cleveland. Trump once he becomes the nominee after the convention.\"366 The day after this exchange, Sater tied Cohen\u0027s travel to Russia to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (\"Forum\"), an annual event attended by prominent Russian politicians and businessmen. Sater told the Office that he was informed by a business associate that Peskov wanted to invite Cohen to the Forum.367 On May 5, 2016, Sater wrote to Cohen: Peskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum which is Russia\u0027s Davos it\u0027s June 16-19. He wants to meet there with you and possibly introduce you to either Putin or Medvedev, as they are not sure if 1 or both will be there. This is perfect. The entire business class of Russia wiU be there as well. He said anything you want to discuss including dates and subjects are on the table to discuss[. ]368 The following day, Sater asked Cohen to confirm those dates would work for him to travel; Cohen wrote back, \"[w]orks for me.\"369 362 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 5. 363 On December 21, 2015, Sater sent Cohen a text message that read, \"They need a copy of DJT passport,\" to which Cohen responded, \"\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_185", "label": "par_185", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e him (as Sater had alleged), and so he decided not to go to the Forum.373 On June 14, 2016, Cohen met Sater in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York and informed him that he would not be traveling at that time. 374 ii. Candidate Trump\u0027s Opportunities to Travel to Russia The investigation identified evidence that, during the period the Trump Moscow project was under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trump visiting Russia arose in two contexts. First, in interviews with the Office, Cohen stated that he discussed the subject of traveling to Russia with Trump twice: once in late 2015; and again in spring 2016.375 According to Cohen, Trump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project significantly. On one occasion, Trump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the candidate\u0027s schedule. Cohen recalled that he spoke with Lewandowski, who suggested that they speak again when Cohen had actual dates to evaluate. Cohen indicated, however, that he knew that travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate\u0027s preexisting commitments to the Campaign.376 Second, like Cohen, Trump received and turned down an invitation to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. In late December 2015, Mira Duma-a contact oflvanka Trump\u0027s from the fashion industry-first passed along invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump from Sergei Prikhodko, a Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.377 On January 14, 2016, Rhona Graff sent an email to Duma stating that Trump was \"honored to be asked to participate in the highly prestigious\" Forum event, but that he would \"have to decline\" the invitation given his \"very grueling and full travel schedule\" as a presidential candidate.378 Graff 37\u00b0 FS000 18 (6/9/16 Text Messages, Sater \u0026 Cohen). 371 6/13/16 Email, Sater to Cohen (2:10 p.m.). 372 FS00018 (6/13/16 Text Message, Sater to Cohen (2:20 p.m.)); 6/13/16 Email, Sater to Cohen. 373 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 6-8. 374 FS00019 (6/14/16 Text Messages, Cohen \u0026 Sater (12:06 and 2:50 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 15}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_187", "label": "par_187", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorttey Work Prodt1et /!

P. 6(e) asked Duma whether she recommended that Graff \"send a formal note to the Deputy Prime Minister\" declining his invitation; Duma replied that a formal note would be \"great.\"379 It does not appear that Graff prepared that note immediately. According to written answers from President Trump,380 Graff received an email from Deputy Prime Minister Prikhodko on March 17, 2016, again inviting Trump to participate in the 2016 Forum in St. Petersburg.381 Two weeks later, on March 31, 2016, Graff prepared for Trump\u0027s signature a two-paragraph letter declining the invitation.382 The letter stated that Trump\u0027s \"schedule has become extremely demanding\" because of the presidential campaign, that he \"already ha[ d] several commitments in the United States\" for the time of the Forum, but that he otherwise \"would have gladly given every consideration to attending such an important event.\"383 Graff forwarded the letter to another executive assistant at the Trump Organization with instructions to print the document on letterhead for Trump to sign.384 At approximately the same time that the letter was being prepared, Robert Foresman-a New York-based investment banker-began reaching out to Graff to secure an in-person meeting with candidate Trump. According to Foresman, he had been asked by Anton Kobyakov, a Russian presidential aide involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speak at the Forum.385 Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction brokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the television show The Apprentice). In his email, Foresman referenced his long-standing personal and professional expertise in Russia and Ukraine, his work setting up an early \"private channel\" between Vladimir Putin and former U.S. President George W. Bush, and an \"approach\" he had received from \"senior Kremlin officials\" about the candidate. Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate, Corey Lewandowski, or \"another relevant person\" to discuss this and other \"concrete things\" Foresman felt uncomfortable discussing over \"unsecure email.\"386 On April 4, 2016, Graff forwarded Foresman\u0027s meeting request to Jessica Macchia, another executive assistant to Trump.387 379 1/15/16 Email, Mira to Graff. 380 As explained in Volume II and Appendix C, on September 17, 2018, the Office sent written questions to the President\u0027s counsel.

According to Foresman, the \"concrete things\" he referenced in the same email were a combination of the invitation itself, Foresman\u0027s personal perspectives on the invitation and Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest Institute). Foresman told the Office that Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him to another Republican presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that Kobyakov had asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate withdrew from the race and the other politician\u0027s participation did not work out.392 Finally, Foresman claimed to have no plans to establish a back channel involving Trump, stating the reference to his involvement in the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnish his credentials to the Campaign. Foresman commented that he had not recognized any of the experts announced as Trump\u0027s foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with the candidate to share his professional background and policy views, including that Trump should decline Kobyakov\u0027s invitation to speak at the Forum.393 2.

Mifsud is a Maltese national who worked as a professor at the London Academy of Diplomacy in London, England.413 Although Mifsud worked out of London and was also affiliated with LCILP, the encounter in Rome was the first time that Papadopoulos met him.414 Mifsud maintained various Russian contacts while living in London, as described further below. Among his contacts was ,415 a one-time employee of the IRA, the entity that carried out the Russian social media campaign (see Volume I Section II, supra). In January and February 2016, Mifsud and -discussed possibly meeting in Russia. The investigation did not~ meeting. Later, in the spring of 2016, -was also in contact -that was linked to an employee of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and that account had overlapping contacts with a group of Russian controlled Facebook accounts that included accounts used to promote the DCLeaks releases in the course of the GRU\u0027s hack-and-release operations (see Volume I, Section III.B.1, supra). According to Papadopoulos, Mifsud at first seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos when they met in Rome.416 After Papadopoulos informed Mifsud about his role in the Trump Campaign, however, Mifsud appeared to take greater interest in Papadopoulos.417 The two discussed Mifsud\u0027s European and Russian contacts and had a general discussion about Russia; Mifsud also offered to introduce Papadopoulos to European leaders and others with contacts to the Russian government.418 Papadopoulos told the Office that Mifsud\u0027s claim of substantial connections with Russian government officials interested Papadopoulos, who thought that such connections could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.419 411 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 2-3; Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r 5. 412 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 2-3; Stephanie Kirchgaessner et al., Joseph Mifsud: more questions than answers about mystery professor linked to Russia, The Guardian (Oct. 31, 2017) (\"Link Campus University ... is headed by a former Italian interior minister named Vincenzo Scotti.\"). 413 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r 5. 414 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 3. , , , \u0141 Investigative Technique 1Harm to Ongoing Matter 416 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r 5. 417 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r 5. 418 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 3; Papadopoulos 8/11/17 302, at 2. 419 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r 5. 83 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 13}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_194", "label": "par_194", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterttey Werle Prnat:tet // May Cef!taifl Material Prnteetea URaer Fee.

Mifsud introduced Polonskaya as a former student of his who had connections to Vladimir Putin.423 Papadopoulos understood at the time that Polonskaya may have been Putin\u0027s niece but later learned that this was not true.424 During the meeting, Polonskaya offered to help Papadopoulos establish contacts in Russia and stated that the Russian ambassador in London was a friend of hers.425 Based on this interaction, Papadopoulos expected Mifsud and Polonskaya to introduce him to the Russian ambassador in London, but that did not occur.426 Following his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos sent an email to members of the Trump Campaign\u0027s foreign policy advisory team. The subject line of the message was \"Meeting with Russian leadership--including Putin.\"427 The message stated in pertinent part: I just finished a very productive lunch with a good friend of mine, Joseph Mifsud, the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy--who introduced me to both Putin\u0027s niece and the Russian Ambassador in London--who also acts as the Deputy Foreign Minister.428 The topic of the lunch was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump. \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_196", "label": "par_196", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e olga putin,\" and \"russian president niece olga,\" among other terms). 425 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 3. 426 Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r 8 n. l. 427 3/24/16 Email, Papadopoulos to Page et al.

On July 31, 2016, following his first in-person meeting with Millian, Papadopoulos emailed Trump Campaign official Bo Denysyk to say that he had been contacted \"by some leaders of Russian-American voters here in the US about their interest in voting for Mr. Trump,\" and to ask whether he should \"put you in touch with their group (US-Russia chamber of commerce).\"507 Denysyk thanked Papadopoulos \"for taking the initiative,\" but asked him to \"hold off with 499 500 7/15/16 Linkedln Message, Millian to Papadopoulos. 501 7 /15/16 Linkedln Message, Millian to Papadopoulos. 502 7/22/16 Facebook Message, Papadopoulos to Timofeev (7:40:23 p.m.); 7/26/16 Facebook Message, Papadopoulos to Timofeev (3:08:57 p.m.). 503 7/23/16 Facebook Message, Timofeev to Papadopoulos (4:31:37 a.m.); 7/26/16 Facebook Message, Timofeev to Papadopoulos (3:37: 16 p.m.). 504 7/16/16 Text Messages, Papadopoulos \u0026 Millian (7:55:43 p.m.). 505 7/30/16 Text Messages, Papadopoulos \u0026 Millian (5:38 \u0026 6:05 p.m.); 7/31/16 Text Messages, Millian \u0026 Papadopoulos (3:48 \u0026 4:18 p.m.); 8/1/16 Text Message, Millian to Papadopoulos (8:19 p.m.). 506 8/2/16 Text Messages, Millian \u0026 Papadopoulos (3 :04 \u0026 3 :05 p.m.); 8/3/16 Facebook Messages, Papadopoulos \u0026 Millian (4:07:37 a.m. \u0026 1:11:58 p.m.). 507 7/31/16 Email, Papadopoulos to Denysyk (12:29:59 p.m.). 94 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 13}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_218", "label": "par_218", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e Trump Campaign after Ed Cox, a state Republican Party official, introduced Page to Trump Campaign officials.539 Page told the Office that his goal in working on the Campaign was to help candidate Trump improve relations with Russia.540 To that end, Page emailed Campaign officials offering his thoughts on U.S.-Russia relations, prepared talking points and briefing memos on Russia, and 529 Buryakov Complaint. 530 Buryakov Complaint. 531 Buryakov Complaint. 532 See Buryakov Com laint; see also Indictment United States v.

Gordon, and Walid Phares and suggested that candidate Trump take his place speaking at the commencement ceremony in Moscow.557 On June 19, 2016, Page followed up again to request approval to speak at the NES event and to reiterate that NES \"would love to have Mr. Trump speak at this annual celebration\" in Page\u0027s place.558 Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski responded the same day, saying, \"If you want to do this, it would be out side [sic] of your role with the DJT for President campaign.

In a private conversation, Dvorkovich expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the vast range of current international problems. Based on feedback from a diverse array of other sources close to the Presidential Administration, it was readily apparent that this sentiment is widely held at all levels of government.578 The Office was unable to obtain additional evidence or testimony about who Page may have met or communicated with in Moscow; thus, Page\u0027s activities in Russia-as described in his emails with the Campaign-were not fully explained. 576 Page 3/10/17 302, at 3; Page 3/30/17 302, at 7; Page 3/31/17 302, at 2. 577 578 579 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 10}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_228", "label": "par_228", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e Trump Campaign would be to organize an advisory group of experts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent with Trump\u0027s voice.608 Simes believed that Kushner was receptive to that suggestion.609 Simes also had contact with other individuals associated with the Trump Campaign regarding the Campaign\u0027s foreign policy positions.

Gordon, to take a hands-off approach and only to challenge platform planks if they directly contradicted Trump\u0027s wishes.793 On July 11, 2016, delegate Diana Denman submitted a proposed platform amendment that included provision of armed support for Ukraine.794 The amendment described Russia\u0027s \"ongoing military aggression\" in Ukraine and announced \"supp01t\" for \"maintaining (and, if warranted, increasing) sanctions against Russia until Ukraine\u0027s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored\" and for \"providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine\u0027s armed forces and greater coordination with NA TO on defense planning.\"795 Gordon reviewed the proposed platform changes, including Denman\u0027s.796 Gordon stated that he flagged this amendment because of Trump\u0027s stated position on Ukraine, which Gordon personally heard the candidate say at the March 31 foreign policy meeting-namely, that the Europeans should take primary responsibility for any assistance to Ukraine, that there should be improved U.S.-Russia relations, and that he did not want to start World War III over that region.797 Gordon told the Office that Trump\u0027s statements on the campaign trail following the March meeting underscored those positions to the point where Gordon felt obliged to object to the proposed platform change and seek its dilution.798 On July 11, 2016, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Platform Subcommittee, Denman offered her amendment.799 Gordon and another Campaign staffer, Matt Miller, approached a committee co-chair and asked him to table the amendment to permit further discussion.800 Gordon\u0027s concern with the amendment was the language about providing \"lethal 790 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 1 0; Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 1-2. 791 Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 1; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 10. 792 Mashburn 6/25/18 302, at 4; Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 7-8. 793 Mashburn 6/25/18 302, at 4; Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10. 794 DENMAN 000001-02, DENMAN 000012, DENMAN 000021-22; Denman 12/4/17 302, at 1; Denman 6/7 /17 302, at 2. 795 DENMAN 000001-02, DENMAN 000012, DENMAN 000021-22. 796 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10-11. 797 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 11; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 11; Gordon 2/14/19 302, at 1-2, 5-6. 798 Gordon 2/14/19 302, at 5-6. 799 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 2; see DENMAN 000014. 800 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 2; Denman 12/4/17 302, at 2; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 11-12; see Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 2. 125 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_270", "label": "par_270", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AMerttey Werk Predttet // May Cetttaitt MU-1:erial Preteetea Uttaer Fed.

Paul Manafort Paul Manafort served on the Trump Campaign, including a period as campaign chairman, from March to August 2016.838 Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. Manafort stayed in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort\u0027s office in Kiev and who the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence. Manafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign and a longtime employee, 839 to provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign-including internal polling data, although Manafort claims not to recall that specific instruction. Manafort expected Kilimnik to share that information with others in Ukraine and with Deripaska.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) Manafort also twice met Kilimnik in the United States during the campaign period and conveyed campaign information. The second meeting took place on August 2, 2016, in New York City. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a message from former Ukrainian President Viktor Y anukovych, who was then living in Russia. The message was about a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort has since acknowledged was a \"backdoor\" means for Russia to control eastern Ukraine. Several months later, after the presidential election, Kilimnik wrote an email to Manafort expressing the view-which Manafort later said he shared-that the plan\u0027s success would require U.S. support to succeed: \"all that is required to start the process is a very minor \u0027wink\u0027 ( or slight push) from [Donald Trump ].\"840 The email also stated that if Manafort were designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his reception in Russia \"at the very top level.\" Manafort communicated with Kilimnik about peace plans for Ukraine on at least four occasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2: December 2016 (the Kilimnik email described above); January 2017; February 2017; and again in the spring of 2018. The Office reviewed numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about the plan in written questions.841 The investigation did not uncover evidence ofManafort\u0027s passing along information about Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or the Administration. The Office was not, however, able to gain access to all of Manafort\u0027s electronic communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications). And while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new Administration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was among the reasons that the district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement. 842 The Office could not reliably determine Manafort\u0027s ur ose in sharin with Kilimnik during the campaign period.

Based on that conduct, the Office determined that Manafort had breached his plea agreement and could not be a cooperating witness. The judge presiding in Manafort\u0027s D.C. criminal case found by a preponderance of the evidence that Manafort intentionally made multiple false statements to the FBI, the Office, and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues). Although the report refers at times to Manafort\u0027 s statements, it does so only when those statements are sufficiently corroborated to be trustworthy, to identify issues on which Manafort\u0027s untruthful responses may themselves be of evidentiary value, or to provide Manafort\u0027s explanations for certain events, even when we were unable to determine whether that explanation was credible. 130 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_278", "label": "par_278", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e and resolve a \"disagreement\"-a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort\u0027s credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort\u0027s sharing polling data and Russia\u0027s interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts. a. Paul Manafort\u0027s Ties to Russia and Ukraine Manafort\u0027 s Russian contacts during the campaign and transition periods stem from his consulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate political consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company Dl\\1P International LLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this entire period and continued to communicate with Manafort through at least June 2018. Kilimnik, who speaks and writes Ukrainian and Russian, facilitated many of Manafort\u0027s communications with Deripaska and Ukrainian oligarchs. i. Oleg Deripaska Consulting Work In approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who has a global empire involving aluminum and power companies and who is closely aligned with Vladimir Putin.843 A memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for Deripaska in 2005 regarding the post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin and the benefits that the work could confer on \"the Putin Government.\"844 Gates described the work Manafort did for Deripaska as \"political risk insurance,\" and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install friendly political officials in countries where Deripaska had business interests.845 Manafort\u0027s company earned tens of millions of dollars from its work for Deripaska and was loaned millions of dollars by Deripaska as well.846 In 2007, Deripaska invested through another entity in Pericles Emerging Market Partners L.P. (\"Pericles\"), an investment fund created by Manafort and former Manafort business partner Richard Davis. The Pericles fund was established to pursue investments in Eastern Europe.847 Deripaska was the sole investor.848 Gates stated in interviews with the Office that the venture led 843 Pinchuk et al., Russian Tycoon Deripaska in Putin Delegation to China, Reuters (June 8, 2018). 844 6/23/05 Memo, Manafort \u0026 Davis to Deripaska \u0026 Rothchild. 845 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 7. 846 Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 2-5; Manafort Income by Year, 2005 -2015; Manafort Loans from Wire Transfers, 2005 -2015. 847 Gates 3/12/18 302, at 5. 848 Manafort 12/16/15 Dep., at 157:8-11. 131 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 16}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_279", "label": "par_279", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Att6mey W6rk Prndttet // Miey Cmitaitt Material Preteeted Umier Fed.

Gates stated that, by 2009, Manafort\u0027s business relationship with Deripaska had \"dried up.\"850 According to Gates, various interactions with Deripaska and his intermediaries over the past few years have involved trying to resolve the legal dispute. 851 As described below, in 2016, Manafort, Gates, Kilimnik, and others engaged in efforts to revive the Deripaska relationship and resolve the litigation. ii. Political Consulting Work Through Deripaska, Manafort was introduced to Rinat Akhmetov, a Ukrainian oligarch who hired Manafort as a political consultant.852 In 2005, Akhmetov hired Manafort to engage in political work supporting the Party of Regions,853 a political party in Ukraine that was generally understood to align with Russia. Manafort assisted the Party of Regions in regaining power, and its candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, won the presidency in 2010. Manafort became a close and trusted political advisor to Y anukovych during his time as President of Ukraine. Y anukovych served in that role until 2014, when he fled to Russia amidst popular protests.854 iii. Konstantin Kilimnik Kilimnik is a Russian national who has lived in both Russia and Ukraine and was a longtime Manafort employee.855 Kilimnik had direct and close access to Yanukovych and his senior entourage, and he facilitated communications between Manafort and his clients, including Yanukovych and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs.856 Kilimnik also maintained a relationship with Deripaska\u0027s deputy, Viktor Boyarkin,857 a Russian national who previously served in the defense attache office of the Russian Embassy to the United \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_282", "label": "par_282", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attet\u0027tle)\u0027 Werk Predttet /,\u0027 Mtty Cefl:tttil\u0027l Mttterittl Preteeted UHder Fed.

In early 2018, Manafort retained his longtime polling firm to craft a draft poll in Ukraine, sent the pollsters a three-page primer on the plan sent by Kilimnik, and worked with Kilimnik to formulate the polling questions.960 The primer sent to the pollsters specifically called for the United States and President Trump to support the Autonomous Republic of Donbas with Yanukovych as Prime Minister,961 and a series of questions in the draft poll asked for opinions on Yanukovych\u0027s role in resolving the conflict in Donbas.962 (The poll was not solely about Donbas; it also sought participants\u0027 views on leaders apart from Yanukovych as they pertained to the 2019 Ukraine presidential election.) The Office has not uncovered evidence that Manafort brought the Ukraine peace plan to the attention of the Trump Campaign or the Trump Administration. Kilimnik continued his efforts to promote the peace plan to the Executive Branch (e.g., U.S. Department of State) into the summer of 2018.963 B. Post-Election and Transition-Period Contacts Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Beginning immediately after the election, individuals connected to the Russian government started contacting officials on the Trump Campaign and Transition Team through multiple channels-sometimes through Russian Ambassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who sought reliable contacts through U.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The investigation did not establish that these efforts reflected or constituted coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its interference activities. 1. Immediate Post-Election Activity As soon as news broke that Trump had been elected President, Russian government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new Administration. They appeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with senior officials around the President-Elect. As explained below, those efforts entailed both official contact through the Russian Embassy in the United States and outreaches-sanctioned at high levels of the Russian government-through business rather than political contacts. 959 Manafort (D.D.C.)

High-Level Encouragement of Contacts through Alternative Channels As Russian officials in the United States reached out to the President-Elect and his team, a number of Russian individuals working in the private sector began their own efforts to make contact. Petr Aven, a Russian national who heads Alfa-Bank, Russia\u0027s largest commercial bank, described to the Office interactions with Putin during this time period that might account for the tlurry of Russian activity.976 \u00b7 Aven told the Office that he is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Putin in the Kremlin; these 50 men are often referred to as \"oligarchs.\"977 Aven told the Office that he met on a quarterly basis with Putin, including in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2016, shortly after the U.S. presidential election.978 Aven said that he took these meetings seriously and understood that any suggestions or critiques that Putin made during these meetings were implicit directives, and that there would be consequences for A ven if he did not follow through.979 As was typical, the 2016 Q4 meeting with Putin was preceded by a preparatory meeting with Putin\u0027s chief of staff, Anton Vaino.980 According to A ven, at his Q4 2016 one-on-one meeting with Putin,981 Putin raised the prospect that the United States would impose additional sanctions on Russian interests, including sanctions against Aven and/or Alfa-Bank.982 Putin suggested that Aven needed to take steps to protect himself and Alfa-Bank.983 Aven also testified that Putin spoke of the difficulty faced by the Russian government in getting in touch with the incoming Trump Administration.984 According to Aven, Putin indicated that he did not know with whom formally to speak and generally did not know the people around the President-Elect.985 976 A ven rovided information to the Office in an interview and through an attorney proffer, Ill 977 A ven 8/2/18 3 02, at 7. 978 979 Aven 8/2/18 302, at2-3. 980 and interview with the Office, A ven referred to the high-ranking Russian government officials using numbers (e.g., Official 1, Official 2).

See Affidavit of Ryan Junck (Aug. 2, 2018) (hard copy on file). 981 At the time of his Q4 2016 meeting with Putin, A ven was generally aware of the press coverage about Russian interference in the U.S. election.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) Aven told Putin he would take steps to protect himself and the Alfa-Bank shareholders from potential sanctions, and one of those steps would be to try to reach out to the incoming Administration to establish a line of communication.986 A ven described Putin responding with skepticism about Aven\u0027s prospect for success.987 According to Aven, although Putin did not expressly direct him to reach out to the Trump Transition Team, Aven understood that Putin expected him to try to respond to the concerns he had raised. 988 A ven\u0027 s efforts are described in Volume I, Section IV.B.5, infra. 2. Kirill Dmitriev\u0027s Transition-Era Outreach to the Incoming Administration Aven\u0027s description of his interactions with Putin is consistent with the behavior of Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian national who heads Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund and is closely connected to Putin. Dmitriev undertook efforts to meet members of the incoming Trump Administration in the months after the election. Dmitriev asked a close business associate who worked for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) royal court, George Nader, to introduce him to Trump transition officials, and Nader eventually arranged a meeting in the Seychelles between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a Trump Campaign supporter and an associate of Steve Bannon.989 In addition, the UAE national security advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund manager and friend of Jared Kushner, Rick Gerson, in late November 2016. In December 2016 and January 2017, Dmitriev and Gerson worked on a proposal for reconciliation between the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied he cleared through Putin. Gerson provided that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. a. Background Dmitriev is a Russian national who was appointed CEO of Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), when it was founded in 2011.990 Dmitriev reported directly to Putin and frequently referred to Putin as his \"boss.\"991 RDIF has co-invested in various projects with UAE sovereign wealth funds.992 Dmitriev regularly interacted with Nader, a senior advisor to UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed 989 Nader provided information to the Office in multi le interviews, all but one of which were conducted under a proffer agreement . The investi ators also interviewed Prince under a proffer agreement. Bannon was interviewed by the Office, under a proffer agreement. 99\u00b0 Kirill Dmitriev Biography, Russian Direct Investment Fund, available at https://rdif.ru/Eng_person _ dmitriev _ kiri II/.

We understand all of the sensitivities and are not in a rush.\"1017 Dmitriev and Nader had previously discussed Nader introducing him to the contacts Nader had made within the Trump Campaign.1018 Dmitriev also told Nader that he would ask Putin for permission to travel to the United States, where he would be able to speak to media outlets about the positive impact of Trump\u0027s election and the need for reconciliation between the United States and Russia. 1019 Later that day, Dmitriev flew to New York, where Peskov was separately traveling to attend the chess tournament.1020 Dmitriev invited Nader to the opening of the tournament and noted that, if there was \"a chance to see anyone key from Trump camp,\" he \"would love to start building for the future.\u0027\u00271021 Dmitriev also asked Nader to invite Kushner to the event so that he (Dmitriev) could meet him. 1022 Nader did not pass along Dmitriev\u0027s invitation to anyone connected with the incoming Administration. 1023 Although one World Chess Federation official recalled hearing from an attendee that President-Elect Trump had stopped \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 10}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_324", "label": "par_324", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterfl:ey Werle Pred1:1et // Mey Cefl:tttifl: Material Prnteeted Under Fed.

He noted in a text message to Gerson that if Russia was \"approached with respect and willingness to understand our position, we can have Major Breakthroughs quickly.\"1105 Gerson and Dmitriev exchanged ideas in December 2016 about what such a reconciliation plan would include.1106 Gerson told the Office that the Transition Team had not asked him to engage in these discussions with Dmitriev, and that he did so on his own initiative and as a private citizen.1107 On January 9, 2017, the same day he asked Nader whether meeting Prince would be worthwhile, Dmitriev sent his biography to Gerson and asked him if he could \"share it with Jared ( or somebody else very senior in the team) -so that they know that we are focused from our side on improving the relationship and my boss asked me to play a key role in that.\"1108 Dmitriev also asked Gerson if he knew Prince, and if Prince was somebody important or worth spending time 1099 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 1. 1100 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 1-2; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 21. 1101 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3-4; see, e.g., 12/2/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev \u0026 Gerson; 12/14/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev \u0026 Gerson; 1/3/17 Text Message, Gerson to Dmitriev; 12/2/16 Email, Tolokonnikov to Gerson. 1102 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3; 12/14/16 Text Message, Dmitriev to Gerson. 1103 12/14/16 Text Message, Gerson to Dmitriev. 1104 12/14/16 Text Message, Gerson to Dmitriev. 1105 12/14/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev \u0026 Gerson; Gerson 6/15/18 302, at 1. 1106 12/14/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev \u0026 Gerson. 1107 Gerson 6/15/18 302, at I. 1108 1/9/17 Text Messages, Dmitriev to Gerson; 1/9/17 Text Message, Dmitriev to Nader. 157 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 17}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_327", "label": "par_327", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e it seriously!\"1124 After the call between President Trump and Putin occurred, Dmitriev wrote to Nader that \"the call went very well.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) Foresman, at the end of an early December 2016 meeting with incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and his designated deputy (K.T.

Foresman had not met Kislyak but told Flynn that, while Kislyak was an important person, Kislyak did not have a direct line to Putin.1132 Foresman subsequently traveled to Moscow, inquired of a source he believed to be close to Putin, and heard back from that source that Ushakov would be the official channel for the incoming U.S. national security advisor.1133 Foresman acknowledged that Flynn had not asked him to undertake that inquiry in Russia but told the Office that he nonetheless felt obligated to report the information back to Flynn, and that he worked to get a face-to-face meeting with Flynn in January 2017 so that he could do so.1134 Email correspondence suggests that the meeting ultimately went forward, 1135 but Flynn has no recollection of it or of the earlier December meeting.1136 (The investigation did not identify evidence of Flynn or Kushner meeting with Ushakov after being given his name.1137) In the meantime, although he had already formed the impression that Kislyak was not necessarily the right point of contact, 1138 Kushner went forward with the meeting that Kislyak had requested on November 16. It took place at Trump Tower on November 30, 2016.1139 At Kushner\u0027 s invitation, Flynn also attended; Bannon was invited but did not attend.1140 During the meeting, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, Kushner expressed a desire on the part of the incoming Administration to start afresh with U.S.-Russian relations.1141 Kushner also asked Kislyak to identify the best person (whether Kislyak or someone else) with whom to direct future discussions-someone who had contact with Putin and the ability to speak for him.1142 The three men also discussed U.S. policy toward Syria, and Kislyak floated the idea of having Russian generals brief the Transition Team on the topic using a secure communications line.1143 After Flynn explained that there was no secure line in the Transition Team offices, 1132 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 17. 1133 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 17-18. 1134 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 18. 1135 RMF-SCO-00000015 (1/5/17 Email, Foresman to Atencio \u0026 Flaherty); RMF-SCO-00000015 (1/5/17 Email, Flaherty to Foresman \u0026 Atencio).

Jared Kushner\u0027s Meeting with Sergey Gorkov On December 6, 2016, the Russian Embassy reached out to Kushner\u0027s assistant to set up a second meeting between Kislyak and Kushner.1146 Kushner declined several proposed meeting dates, but Kushner\u0027s assistant indicated that Kislyak was very insistent about securing a second meeting.1147 Kushner told the Office that he did not want to take another meeting because he had already decided Kislyak was not the right channel for him to communicate with Russia, so he arranged to have one of his assistants, A vi Berkowitz, meet with Kislyak in his stead.1148 Although embassy official Sergey Kuznetsov wrote to Berkowitz that Kislyak thought it \"important\" to \"continue the conversation with Mr. Kushner in person,\"1149 Kislyak nonetheless \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_330", "label": "par_330", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e agreed to meet \u00b7 instead with Berkowitz once it became apparent that Kushner was unlikely to take a meeting.

Kushner agreed to meet with Gorkov.1151 The one-on-one meeting took place the next day, December 13, 2016, at the Colony Capital building in Manhattan, where Kushner had previously scheduled meetings.1152 VEB was (and is) the subject of Department of Treasury economic sanctions imposed in response to Russia\u0027s annexation of Crimea. 1153 Kushner did not, however, recall any discussion during his meeting with Gorkov about the sanctions against VEB or sanctions more generally.1154 Kushner stated in an interview that he did not engage in any preparation for 1144 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18. 1145 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18. 1146 Kushner Strut. at 7; NOSC00000123 (12/6/16 Email, Vargas to Kushner (12: 11 :40 p.m.)). 1147 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; NOSC00000130 (12/12/16 Email, Kushner to Vargas (10:41 p.m.)). 1148 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; Kushner Stmt. at 7; DJTFP_SCO_01442290 (12/6/16 Email, Berkowitz to 1149 DJTFP SCO 01442290 (12/7/16 Email --to Berkowitz (12:31 :39 p.m.)). 1150 Berkowitz 1/12/18 302, at 7; AKIN_GUMP_BERKOWITZ_O0000l-04 (12/12/16 Text Messages, Berkowitz \u0026 202-701-8532). 1151 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; NOSC00000130-135 (12/12/16 Email, Kushner to Berkowitz). 1152 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19; NOSC00000130-135 (12/12/16 Email, Kushner to Berkowitz). 1153 Announcement of Treasury Sanctions on Entities Within the Financial Services and Energy Sectors of Russia, Against Arms or Related Materiel Entities, and those Undermining Ukraine\u0027s Sovereignty, United States Department of the Treasury (Jul. 16, 2014). 1154 Kushner 4/11 /18 302, at 20. 161 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 14}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_333", "label": "par_333", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atlorfte\u0027.\u0027,\u0027 \u0027illerk Preduet // Miey\u00b7 Ce:mtatft Matef\u0027ittl Preteeted UH:der Fed.

Regardless, the investigation did not identify evidence that Kushner and Gorkov engaged in any substantive follow-up after the meeting. Rather, a few days after the meeting, Gorkov\u0027s assistant texted Kushner\u0027s assistant, \"Hi, please inform your side that the information about the meeting had a very positive response!\"\u0027 163 Over the following weeks, the two assistants exchanged a handful of additional cordial texts.1164 On February 8, 2017, Gorkov\u0027s assistant texted Kushner\u0027s assistant (Berkowitz) to try to set up another meeting, and followed up by text at least twice in the days that followed.1165 According to Berkowitz, he did not respond to the meeting request in light of the press coverage regarding the Russia investigation, and did not tell Kushner about the meeting request.1166 5. Petr Aven\u0027s Outreach Efforts to the Transition Team In December 2016, weeks after the one-on-one meeting with Putin described in Volume I, Section IV.B.1.b, supra, Petr Aven attended what he described as a separate \"all-hands\" oligarch meeting between Putin and Russia\u0027s most prominent businessmen.1167 As in Aven\u0027s one-on-one meeting, a main topic of discussion at the oligarch meeting in December 2016 was the prospect of forthcoming U.S. economic sanctions.1168 After the December 2016 all-hands meeting, A ven tried to establish a connection to the Trump team.

There is an interest and an understanding for the need to establish such a channel. But the individual emphasized that at this moment, with so much intense interest in the Congress and the media over the question of cyber-hacking (and who ordered what), Project A was too explosive to discuss.

All clear.\"1184 According to Aven, this statement indicated that he did not want the outreach to continue.1185 Burt spoke to A ven some time thereafter about his attempt to make contact with the Trum team, ~hat the current environment made it impossible, ____ 1186 Burt did not recall discussing Aven\u0027s request with Simes again, nor did he recall speaking to anyone else about the request.1187 In the first quarter of 2017, A ven met again with Putin and other Russian officials.1188 At that meeting, Putin asked about Aven\u0027s attem t to build relations with the Trum Administration and A ven recounted his lack of success. 1189 -1190 Putin continued to inquire about Aven\u0027s efforts to connect to the Trump Administration in several subsequent quarterly meetings. 1191 Aven also told Putin\u0027s chief of staff that he had been subpoenaed by the FBI.1192 As part of that conversation, he reported that he had been asked by the FBI about whether he had worked to create a back channel between the Russian government and the Trump Administration.1193 1181 12/22/16 Email, Burt to Aven (7:23 p.m.). 1182 Burt 2/9/18 302, at 3. 1183 Burt 2/9/18 302, at 3-4. 1184 12/22/16 Email, Aven to Butt (4:58:22 p.m.). 1185 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 7. 1186 1187 Burt 2/9/18 302, at 3-4. 1188 I 189 I 190 1191 1192 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 8. 1193 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 8; 165 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 13}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_340", "label": "par_340", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e ain visited Moscow in an attem t to ursue business o ortunities.II95 According to Konstantin Kilimnik, Paul Manafort\u0027 s associate, Page also gave some individuals in Russia the impression that he had maintained his connections to President-Elect Trump.

Flynn Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was the Transition Team\u0027s primary conduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt with Russia on two sensitive matters during the transition period: a United Nations Security Council vote and the Russian government\u0027s reaction to the United States\u0027s imposition of sanctions for Russian interference in the 2016 election.1207 Despite Kushner\u0027 s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside the Russian government, the Transition Team turned to Flynn\u0027s relationship with Kislyak on both issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming deputy, to prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect and other senior members of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time. Although transition officials at a-Lago had some concern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did not identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn asked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on December 29, 2016, and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that request. a. United Nations Vote on Israeli Settlements On December 21, 2016, Egypt submitted a resolution to the United Nations Security Council calling on Israel to cease settlement activities in Palestinian territory\u0027. 1208 The Security Council, which includes Russia, was scheduled to vote on the resolution the following day.1209 There was speculation in the media that the Obama Administration would not oppose the resolution.1210 1204 1205 1206 1207 As discussed further in Volume I, Section V.C.4, infra, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, about these communications with Ambassador Kislyak.

In addition to her conversations with Bannon and Reince Priebus, at 4:43 p.m., McFarland sent an email to Transition Team members about the sanctions, informing the group that \"Gen [F]lynn is talking to russian ambassador this evening.\"1251 Less than an hour later, McFarland briefed President-Elect Trump.

P. 6(e) The next day, December 30, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked that Russia would respond in kind to the sanctions.1262 Putin superseded that comment two hours later, releasing a statement that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time.1263 Hours later President-Elect Trump tweeted, \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin).\"1264 Shortly thereafter, Flynn sent a text message to McFarland summarizing his call with Kislyak from the day before, which she emailed to Kushner, Bannon, Priebus, and other Transition Team members.1265 The text message and email did not include sanctions as one of the topics discussed with Kislyak.1266 Flynn told the Office that he did not document his discussion of sanctions because it could be perceived as getting in the way of the Obama Administration\u0027s foreign policy.1267 On December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at the highest levels and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate to the sanctions in response to the request.1268 Two hours later, Flynn spoke with McFarland and relayed his conversation with Kislyak.1269 According to McFarland, Flynn remarked that the Russians wanted a better relationship and that the relationship was back on track. 127\u00b0 Flynn also told McFarland that he believed his phone call had made a difference.1271 McFarland recalled congratulating Flynn in response.1272 Flynn spoke with other Transition Team members that day, but does not recall whether they discussed the sanctions.1273 Flynn recalled discussing the sanctions with Bannon the next day and that Bannon appeared to know about Flynn\u0027s conversation with Kislyak.1274 Bannon, 1262 Comment by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on recent US sanctions and the expulsion of Russian diplomats, Moscow, December 20, 2016, The Ministry ofForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation (Dec. 30, 2016 (5:32 a.m.)). 1263 Statement of the President of the Russian Federation, Kremlin, Office of the President (Dec. 30, 2016 (7:15 a.m.)). 1264 @realDonaldTrump 12/30/16 (11:41 a.m.) Tweet. 1265 12/30/16 Email, Flynn to McFarland; 12/30/16 Email, McFarland to Kushner et al. 1266 12/30/16 Email, McFarland to Kushner et al. 1267 Flynn 11/17/17 302, at 4. 1268 Call Records of Michael T.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) (1897) (\"An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.\"). For that reason, this Office\u0027s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term \"collusion.\" The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy-either under statutes that have their own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1349, 195l(a)), or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law-including foreign-fnfluence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either under a specific statute or under Section 371 \u0027s offenses clause. The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under Section 371 \u0027s defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a lawful function \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_367", "label": "par_367", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e , 46 (D.D.C.2018). The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign or between such officials and Russia-linked individuals-to interfere with or obstruct a lawful function of a government agency during the campaign or transition period. And, as discussed in Volume I, Section V.A, supra, the investigation did not identify evidence that any Campaign official or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the Office charged, namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, supra. Accordingly, the Office did not charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-related contacts described in Section IV above. 2.

A \"knowing[] and willful[]\" violation involving an aggregate of $2,000 or more in a calendar year, but less than $25,000, is a misdemeanor. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(l)(A)(ii). b. Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting The Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in connection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office concluded that, in light of the government\u0027s substantial burden of proof on issues of intent (\"knowing\" and \"willful\"), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that \"the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.\" Justice Manual\u00a7 9-27.220. In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an \"offer\" from Russia\u0027s \"Crown prosecutor\" to \"the Trump campaign\" of \"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.\u0027s] father.\" The email described this as \"very high level and sensitive information\" that is \"part of Russia and its government\u0027s support to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin.\" Trump Jr. responded: \"if it\u0027s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\" Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up conversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was attended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that could assist candidate Trump\u0027s electoral prospects. This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012 l(a)(l )(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide \"official documents and information\" to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the presidential election. Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those materials. Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner and Mana fort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources. The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the foreign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; the solicitation of an illegal foreignsource contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of \"an express or implied promise to make a 185 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 21}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_386", "label": "par_386", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attomey \u0027Nork Pt10attet // Mtt\u0027.)1 Cotnttit1 Mtttet1ittl Proteetea Ut1aer Fee. R.. Ct1iffi. P. 6(e) 4. False Statements and Obstruction of the Investigation The Office determined that certain individuals associated with the Campaign lied to investigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken other actions to interfere with the investigation. As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected to the Campaign with false statements and obstruction offenses. a. Overview Of Governing Law False Statements. The principal federal statute criminalizing false statements to government investigators is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. As relevant here, under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a crime to knowingly and willfully \"make[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\" \"in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive ... branch of the Government.\" An FBI investigation is a matter within the Executive Branch\u0027s jurisdiction. United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479 (1984). The statute also applies to a subset of legislative branch actions-viz., administrative matters and \"investigation[s] or review[ s ]\" conducted by a congressional committee or subcommittee. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(c)(l) and (2); see United States v. Pickett, 353 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Whether the statement was made to law enforcement or congressional investigators, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non-jurisdictional elements: the statement was false, fictitious, or fraudulent; the defendant knew both that it was false and that it was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false statement was material. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 831 F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements); see also Ninth Circuit Pattern Instruction 8.73 \u0026 cmt. (explaining that the Section 1001 jury instruction was modified in light of the Department of Justice\u0027s position that the phrase \"knowingly and willfully\" in the statute requires the defendant\u0027s knowledge that his or her conduct was unlawful). In the D.C. Circuit, the government must prove that the statement was actually false; a statement that is misleading but \"literally true\" does not satisfy Section 1001 (a)(2). See United States v. Milton, 8 F .3d 39, 45 191 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_389", "label": "par_389", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Moore, 612 F.3d 698, 701 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Perjury. Under the federal perjury statutes, it is a crime for a witness testifying under oath before a grand jury to knowingly make any false material declaration. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. The government must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction under Section 1623(a): the defendant testified under oath before a federal grand jury; the defendant\u0027s testimony was false in one or more respects; the false testimony concerned matters that were material to the grand jury investigation; and the false testimony was knowingly given. United States v. Bridges, 717 F.2d 1444, 1449 n.30 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The general perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, also applies to grand jury testimony and has similar elements, except that it requires that the witness have acted willfully and that the government satisfy \"strict common-law requirements for establishing falsity.\" See Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 \u0026 n.6 (1979) (explaining \"the two-witness rule\" and the corroboration that it demands). Obstruction of Justice. Three basic elements are common to the obstruction statutes pertinent to this Office\u0027s charging decisions: an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal (i.e., corrupt) intent. A detailed discussion of those elements, and the law governing obstruction of justice more generally, is included in Volume II of the report. b. Application to Certain Individuals i. George Papadopoulos Investigators approached Papadopoulos for an interview based on his role as a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to a foreign government representative that Russia had indicated that it could assist the \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_393", "label": "par_393", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e 3, 2017), Doc. 8. On October 7, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to that charge pursuant to a plea agreement. On September 7, 2018, he was sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, a $9,500 fine, and 200 hours of community service. ii.-iii. Michael Flynn Michael Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI on January 24, 2017, four days after he had officially assumed his duties as National Security Advisor to the President. During the interview, Flynn made several false statements pertaining to his communications with the Russian ambassador. First, Flynn made two false statements about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Kislyak in late December 2016, at a time when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering with the 2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response. See Flynn Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain from escalating the situation in response to the United States\u0027s imposition of sanctions. That statement was false. On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to request Russian restraint. Flynn made the call immediately after speaking to a senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about what to communicate to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to report on the substance of that conversation. Flynn also falsely told the FBI that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of Flynn\u0027s request. On December 31, 2016, Flynn in fact had such a conversation with Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the call to relay the substance of his conversation with Kislyak. See Flynn Statement of Offense ,r 3. 194 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 9}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_394", "label": "par_394", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorney 1Nork Prodttet II :May Contain Ma:teria:l Preteeted Under Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) Second, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to representatives of Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that he only asked the countries\u0027 positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That statement was false. On December 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the incoming Trump Administration\u0027s opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn also falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia\u0027s response to his December 22 request regarding the resolution. Kislyak in fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that Russia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote. See Flynn Statement of Offense ,r 4. Flynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as National Security Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Flynn\u0027s false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on that ongoing investigation. Flynn Statement of Offense ,r,r 1-2. They also came shortly before Flynn made separate submissions to the Depa1tment of Justice, pursuant to FARA, that also contained materially false statements and omissions. Id. ,r 5. Based on the totality of that conduct, the Office decided to charge Flynn with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 l00l(a). On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that charge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing. See id.; Plea Agreement, United States v. Michael T Flynn, No. l:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 3. Flynn is awaiting sentencing. iv. Michael Cohen Michael Cohen was the executive vice president and special counsel to the Trump Organization when Trump was president of the Trump Organization. Information ,r 1, United States v. Cohen, No. 1 :18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2018), Doc. 2 (\"Cohen Information\"). From the fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen was involved in a project to build a Trump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow. The project was known as Trump Tower Moscow. In 2017, Cohen was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between Russia and the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen caused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow. Cohen Information ,r,r 2-3. The letter contained three representations relevant here. First, Cohen stated that the Trump Moscow project had ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate Trump on the project only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it. Second, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project and never considered asking Trump to travel for the project. Third, Cohen stated that he did not recall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that 195 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 15}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_396", "label": "par_396", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e Felix Sater his own travel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired about the possibility of Trump traveling there-both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey Lewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov-in particular, that he received an email reply and had a follow-up phone conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016. Cohen Information ,i 7. Cohen knew the statements in the letter to be false at the time, and admitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the project and Trump (who by this time was President), and (2) to give the false impression that the project had ended before the first vote in the Republican Party primary process, in the hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations. Id. Given the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them during his initial interview with the Office, we charged Cohen with violating Section 1001. On November 29, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a single-count information charging him with making false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 100l(a)(2) and (c). Cohen Information. The case was transferred to the district judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern District of New York (after a referral from our Office). On December 7, 2018, this Office submitted a letter to that judge recommending that Cohen\u0027s cooperation with our investigation be taken into account in sentencing Cohen on both the false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern District prosecution. \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 9}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_400", "label": "par_400", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e about the 2016 election, either before or after election day.\" And, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony, Sessions identified two of the campaign-period contacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above, which had been reported in the media following the January 2017 confirmation hearing. Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did \"not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador, or any other representatives of the Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion.\" Although the investigation established that Sessions interacted with Kislyak on the occasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at least one occasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions. With respect to Sessions\u0027s statements that he did \"not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador ... regarding the political campaign\" and he had not been in contact with any Russian official \"about the 2016 election,\" the evidence concerning the nature of Sessions\u0027s interactions with Kislyak makes it plausible that Sessions did not recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of his statements. Similarly, while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he \"did not have communications with Russians,\" he did so in response to a question that had linked such communications to an alleged \"continuing exchange of information\" between the Trump Campaign and Russian government intermediaries. Sessions later explained to the Senate and to the Office that he understood the question as narrowly calling for disclosure of interactions with Russians that involved the exchange of campaign information, as distinguished from more routine contacts with Russian nationals. Given the context in which the question was asked, that understanding is plausible. Accordingly, the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Sessions was willfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a conviction for perjury or false statements. Consistent with the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office therefore determined not to pursue charges against Sessions and informed his counsel of that decision in March 2018. vii. Others Interviewed During the Investigation The Office considered whether, during the course of the investigation, other individuals interviewed either omitted material information or provided information determined to be false. Applying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office did not seek criminal charges against any individuals other than those listed above.

The Order appointing the Special Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that arose directly from the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation, including whether the President had obstructed justice in connection with Russia-related investigations. The Special Counsel\u0027s jurisdiction also covered potentially obstructive acts related to the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation itself. This Volume of our report summarizes our obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President. We first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation, and then provide an overview of this Volume: First, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that \"the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions\" in violation of \"the constitutional separation of powers.\"1 Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the Department of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 515; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC\u0027s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC\u0027s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President\u0027s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.2 Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President\u0027s term is permissible.3 The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office.4 And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in 1 A Sitting President\u0027s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op.

R. Ct1im. P. 6(e) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME II Our obstruction-of-justice inquiry focused on a series of actions by the President that related to the Russian-interference investigations, including the President\u0027s conduct towards the law enforcement officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events. FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION The key issues and events we examined include the following: The Campaign\u0027s response to reports about Russian support for Trump. During the 2016 presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government\u0027s apparent support for candidate Trump. After WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump publicly expressed skepticism that Russia was responsible for the hacks at the same time that he and other Campaign officials privately sought information about any further planned WikiLeaks releases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though as late as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow. After the election, the President expressed concerns to advisors that reports of Russia\u0027s election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election. Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn. In mid-January \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_415", "label": "par_415", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e 2017, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President, other administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Russia\u0027s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference. On January 27, the day after the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar statements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Corney to a private dinner at the White House and told Corney that he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President requested Flynn\u0027s resignation, the President told an outside advisor, \"Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over.\" The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would continue. Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting with Corney. Referring to the FBI\u0027s investigation of Flynn, the President said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. T hope you can let this go.\" Shortly after requesting Flynn\u0027s resignation and speaking privately to Corney, the President sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating that the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined because she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel\u0027s Office attorney thought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered. The President\u0027s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation. Tn February 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from related investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign. Tn early March, the President told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing. And after Sessions announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors that he should have an Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, the President took Sessions aside at an event and urged him to \"unrecuse.\" Later in March, Corney publicly 3 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 10}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_416", "label": "par_416", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Aftefl\u00271e~\u00b7 Werk Preettet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteetea Uttder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) disclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI was investigating \"the Russian government\u0027s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,\" including any links or coordination between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the President reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort. The President also twice called Corney directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Corney had previously assured the President that the FBI was not investigating him personally, and the President asked Corney to \"lift the cloud\" of the Russia investigation by saying that publicly. The President\u0027s termination of Comey. On May 3, 2017, Corney testified in a congressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether the President was personally under investigation. Within days, the President decided to terminate Corney. The President insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Corney had informed the President that he was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White House maintained that Corney\u0027s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Corney should be discharged for mishandling the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire Corney before hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing Corney, the President told Russian officials that he had \"faced great pressure because of Russia,\" which had been \"taken off\u0027 by Corney\u0027s firing. The next day, the President acknowledged in a television interview that he was going to fire Corney regardless of the Department of Justice\u0027s recommendation and that when he \"decided to just do it,\" he was thinking that \"this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\" In response to a question about whether he was angry with Corney about the Russia investigation, the President said, \"As far as I\u0027m concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly,\" adding that firing Corney \"might even lengthen out the investigation.\" The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him. On May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conduct the investigation and related matters. The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had been appointed by telling advisors that it was \"the end of his presidency\" and demanding that Sessions resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The President told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special Counsel therefore could not serve. The President\u0027s advisors told him the asserted conflicts were meritless and had already been considered by the Department of Justice. On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel\u0027s Office was investigating whether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this \"a major turning point\" in the investigation: while Corney had told the President he was not under investigation, following Corney\u0027s firing, the President now was under investigation. The President reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation. On June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre. 4 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_417", "label": "par_417", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AtterHe:) Werle Preattet // May CeHtaiH Mitteria:1 Preteetea UHder Fee. R. Crim. P. 6(e) Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation. Two days after directing McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and dictated a message for Lewandowski to \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_418", "label": "par_418", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was \"very unfair\" to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special Counsel and \"let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections.\" Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do. One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions\u0027s job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President\u0027s message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through. Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence. In the summer of 2017, the President learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was said to \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_420", "label": "par_420", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attot1Aey Wot1k Protittet // Muy CoHtuiA Muteriul Proteeteti UAtiet\u0027 Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) have the Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather than carry out the order. The President reacted to the news stories by directing White House officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials that the media reports were accurate in stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. The President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the reports. In the same meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special Counsel about the President\u0027s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes of his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered happening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle. Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort,~. After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President\u0027s personal counsel left a message for Flynn\u0027s attorneys reminding them of the President\u0027s warm feelings towards Flynn, which he said \"still remains,\" and asking for a \"heads up\" if Flynn knew \"information that implicates the President.\" When Flynn\u0027s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President\u0027s personal counsel said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn\u0027s actions reflected \"hostility\" towards the President. During Manafort\u0027s prosecution and when the jury in his criminal. trial was deliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that Manafort was being treated unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After Manafort was convicted, the President called Manafort \"a brave man\" for refusin to \"break\" and said that \"fli in \" \"almost ou ht to be Conduct involving Michael Cohen. The President\u0027s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized the President\u0027s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when he became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the project, including stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a \"party line\" that Cohen said was developed to minimize the President\u0027s connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President\u0027s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should \"stay on message\" and not contradict the President. After the FBI searched Cohen\u0027s home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not \"flip,\" contacted him directly to tell him to \"stay strong,\" and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President\u0027s personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a \"rat,\" and suggested that his family members had committed crimes. 6 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_434", "label": "par_434", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AMat\u0027Ae)\u0027 \u0027ilafk Pt\u0027adttet // Muy CaAtO:it\u0027l M0:teri0:I Prateeted UAder Fed.

Sampson, 898 F.3d 287,302 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988) ( collecting cases). \"It is well established that a[ n] [obstruction-of-justice] offense is complete when one corruptly endeavors to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice; the prosecution need not prove that the due administration of justice was actually obstructed or impeded.\" United States v.

Investigative and Evidentiary Considerations After the appointment of the Special Counsel, this Office obtained evidence about the following events relating to potential issues of obstruction of justice involving the President: (a) The President\u0027s January 27, 2017 dinner with former FBI Director James Corney in which the President reportedly asked for Corney\u0027s loyalty, one day after the White House had been briefed by the Department of Justice on contacts between former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador; (b) The President\u0027s February 14, 2017 meeting with Corney in which the President reportedly asked Corney not to pursue an investigation of Flynn; (c) The President\u0027s private requests to Corney to make public the fact that the President was not the subject of an FBI investigation and to lift what the President regarded as a cloud; (d) The President\u0027s outreach to the Director of National Intelligence and the Directors of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency about the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation; (e) The President\u0027s stated rationales for terminating Corney on May 9, 2017, including statements that could reasonably be understood as acknowledging that the FBT\u0027s Russia investigation was a factor in Corney\u0027s termination; and (f) The President\u0027s reported involvement in issuing a statement about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russians and senior Trump Campaign officials that said the meeting was about adoption and omitted that the Russians had offered to provide the Trump Campaign with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. Taking into account that information and our analysis of applicable statutory and constitutional principles (discussed below in Volume II, Section III, infra), we determined that \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 10}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_436", "label": "par_436", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Protittet // May Cmtt1:tifl Material Proteeteti Ut1der Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) voluntary basis when possible, and used legal process where appropriate. These investigative steps allowed us to gather a substantial amount of evidence. We also sought a voluntary interview with the President. After more discussion, the President declined to be interviewed. During the course of our discussions, the President did agree to answer written questions on certain Russia-related topics, and he provided us with answers. He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during the transition. Ultimately, while we believed that we had the authority and legal justification to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the President\u0027s testimony, we chose not to do so. We made that decision in view of the substantial delay that such an investigative step would likely produce at a late stage in our investigation. We also assessed that based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the President\u0027s actions and his public and private statements describing or explaining those actions, we had sufficient evidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the President\u0027s testimony. The Office\u0027s decision-making process on this issue is described in more detail in Appendix C, infra, in a note that precedes the President\u0027s written responses. In assessing the evidence we obtained, we relied on common principles that apply in any investigation. The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (I Ith Cir. 2016) (\"[G]uilty knowledge can rarely be established by direct evidence .... Therefore, mens rea elements such as knowledge or intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 36 (2d Cir. 2012) (\"The government\u0027s case rested on circumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of knowledge and intent can often be proved through circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).

R. Crim. P. 6(e) II. FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION This section of the report details the evidence we obtained. We first provide an overview of how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, and how candidate Trump responded. We then tum to the key events that we investigated: the President\u0027s conduct concerning the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the President\u0027s reaction to public confirmation of the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation; events leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Corney; efforts to terminate the Special Counsel; efforts to curtail the scope of the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russians and senior campaign officials; efforts to have the Attorney General unrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other witnesses. We summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three statutory obstruction-of-justice elements: obstructive act, nexus to a proceeding, and intent. We focus on elements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel has \"jurisdiction ... to investigate ... federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a). Consistent with our jurisdiction to investigate federal obstruction crimes, we gathered evidence that is relevant to the elements of those crimes and analyzed them within an elements framework-while refraining from reaching ultimate conclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above. This section also does not address legal and constitutional defenses raised by counsel for the President; those defenses are analyzed in Volume II, Section III, iefra. A. The Campaign\u0027s Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump During the 2016 campaign, the media raised questions about a possible connection between the Trump Campaign and Russia.7 The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia. Trump responded to questions about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement in Russia-even though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late as June 2016. Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same time as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information about any further planned WikiLeaks releases. After the election, when questions persisted about possible links between Russia and the Trump Campaign, the President-Elect continued to deny any connections to Russia and privately expressed concerns that reports of Russian election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election.8 7 This section summarizes and cites various news stories not for the truth of the information contained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump\u0027s response to those stories in context. Volume I of this report analyzes the underlying facts of several relevant events that were reported on by the media during the campaign. 8 As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives ofthe Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. 15 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_441", "label": "par_441", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorfte~\u00b7 Work Proattet // May CoHtaiH Material Pt1oteetea Uftaer Fee.

For example, the press reported that campaign advisor Michael Flynn was seated next to Vladimir Putin at an RT gala in Moscow in December 2015 and that Flynn had appeared regularly on RT as an analyst.15 The press also reported that foreign policy advisor Carter Page had ties to a Russian state-run gas company, 16 and that campaign chairman Paul Manafort had done work for the \"Russian-backed former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.\"17 In addition, the press raised questions during the Republican 9 @realDonaldTrump 6/16/15 (11 :57 a.m. ET) Tweet. 10 See, e.g., Meet the Press Interview with Donald J.

The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Corney in which he asked for Corney\u0027s loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign.

The Media Raises Questions About the President\u0027s Delay in Terminating Flynn After Flynn was forced to resign, the press raised questions about why the President waited more than two weeks after the DOJ notification to remove Flynn and whether the President had known about Flynn\u0027s contacts with Kislyak before the DOJ notification.244 The press also continued to raise questions about connections between Russia and the President\u0027s campaign.245 On February 15, 2017, the President told reporters, \"General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he\u0027s been treated very, very unfairly by the media.\"246 On February 16, 2017, the President held 241 Corney 11/15/17 302, at 11; Hearing on Russian Election Interference Before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, I 15th Cong.

After the Vice President and senior White House officials reviewed the underlying information about Flynn\u0027s calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that Flynn could not have forgotten his conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been lying. In addition, the President\u0027s instruction to the FBI Director to \"let[] Flynn go\" suggests his awareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of prosecution. c. Intent. As part of our investigation, we examined whether the President had a personal stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flynn-for example, whether the President was aware of Flynn\u0027s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred, such that the President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that those lies had been passed on to the public. Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and content of Flynn\u0027s calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be relied upon to establish the President\u0027s knowledge. In advance of Flynn\u0027s initial call with Kislyak, the President attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have mentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak. Flynn told McFarland about the substance of his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a difference in Russia\u0027s response, and Flynn recalled talking to Bannon in early January 2017 about how they had successfully \"stopped the train on Russia\u0027s response\" to the sanctions. It would have been reasonable for Flynn to have wanted the President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn his request had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate in response to the request, and the President was pleased by the Russian response, calling it a \"[g]reat move.\" And the President never said publicly or internally that Flynn \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_504", "label": "par_504", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AMerf\u0027le)\u0027 Werk Preettet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteetee Utteer Fee. R. Griff!. P. 6(e) possessed information damaging to the President that would give the President a personal incentive to end the FBI\u0027s inquiry into Flynn\u0027s conduct. Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI\u0027s broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_505", "label": "par_505", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e that terminating Flynn would end \"the whole Russia thing.\" Flynn\u0027s firing occurred at a time when the media and Congress were raising questions about Russia\u0027s interference in the election and whether members of the President\u0027s campaign had colluded with Russia. Multiple witnesses recalled that the President viewed the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election. The President paid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with annoyance and anger when the story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Just hours before meeting one-on-one with Corney, the President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to the Russia inquiries. And after Christie pushed back, telling the President that firing Flynn would not end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach out to Corney and convey that the President liked him and he was part of \"the team.\" That afternoon, the President cleared the room and asked Corney to \"let[] Flynn go.\" We also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President\u0027s direction to Corney was motivated by sympathy towards Flynn. In public statements the President repeatedly described Flynn as a good person who had been harmed by the Russia investigation, and the President directed advisors to reach out to Flynn to tell him the President \"care[d]\" about him and felt bad for him. At the same time, multiple senior advisors, including Bannon, Priebus, and Hicks, said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was forced to resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn. Priebus said he believed the President\u0027s initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal regard, but from concern about the negative press that would be generated by firing the National Security Advisor so early in the Administration. And Priebus indicated that the President\u0027s post-firing expressions of support for Flynn were motivated by the President\u0027s desire to keep Flynn from saying negative things about him. The way in which the President communicated the request to Corney also is relevant to understanding the President\u0027s intent. When the President first learned about the FBI investigation into Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter with anyone else in the White House. The next day, the President invited Corney for a one-on-one dinner against the advice of an aide who recommended that other White House officials also attend. At the dinner, the President asked Corney for \"loyalty\" and, at a different point in the conversation, mentioned that Flynn had judgment issues. When the President met with Corney the day after Flynn\u0027s termination-shortly after being told by Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia investigation-the President cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General, so that he could again speak to Corney alone. The President\u0027s decision to meet one-on-one with Corney contravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not communicate directly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of interfering in law enforcement activities. And the President later denied that he cleared the room and asked Corney to \"let[] Flynn go\"-a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion. 47 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_506", "label": "par_506", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AM:eme\u0027.\u0027,\" Wefk Pfeclttet // May Cetttaitt Matefial Pfeteetecl Uttaef Fee. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) Finally, the President\u0027s effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that the President had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the President\u0027s concern about being associated with Flynn\u0027s conduct. The evidence does not establish that the President was trying to have McFarland lie. The President\u0027s request, however, was sufficiently irregular that McFarland-who did not know the full extent of Flynn\u0027s communications with the President and thus could not make the representation the President wanted-felt the need to draft an internal memorandum documenting the President\u0027s request, and Eisenberg was concerned that the request would look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an ambassadorship. C. The President\u0027s Reaction to Public Confirmation of the FBl\u0027s Russia Investigation Overview In early March 2017, the President learned that Sessions was considering rec using from the Russia investigation and tried to prevent the recusal. After Sessions announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at Sessions for the decision and then privately asked Sessions to \"unrecuse.\" On March 20, 2017, Corney publicly disclosed the existence of the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation. In the days that followed, the President contacted Corney and other intelligence agency leaders and asked them to push back publicly on the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort in order to \"lift the cloud\" of the ongoing investigation.

P. 6(e) interpreted the call as an effort by the President to \"pull [him] in,\" but he did not perceive the call as an attempt by the President to find out what Corney was doing with the Flynn investigation.277 The next morning, the President called McGahn and urged him to contact Sessions to tell him not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.278 McGahn understood the President to be concerned that a recusal would make Sessions look guilty for omitting details in his confirmation hearing; leave the President unprotected from an investigation that could hobble the presidency and derail his policy objectives; and detract from favorable press coverage of a Presidential Address to Congress the President had delivered earlier in the week.279 McGahn reached out to Sessions and reported that the President was not happy about the possibility of recusal.280 Sessions replied that he intended to follow the rules on recusal.281 McGahn reported back to the President about the call with Sessions, and the President reiterated that he did not want Sessions to recuse.282 Throughout the day, McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to avert Sessions\u0027s recusal by speaking to Sessions\u0027s personal counsel, Sessions\u0027s chief of staff, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more times.283 Sessions recalled that other White House advisors also called him that day to argue against his recusal. 284 That afternoon, Sessions announced his decision to recuse \"from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.\"285 Sessions believed the decision to recuse was not a close call, given the applicable of James B.

The President Asks Intelligence Community Leaders to Make Public Statements that he had No Connection to Russia In the weeks following Corney\u0027s March 20, 2017 testimony, the President repeatedly asked intelligence community officials to push back publicly on any suggestion that the President had a connection to the Russian election-interference effort. On March 22, 2017, the President asked Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and CIA Director Michael Pompeo to stay behind in the Oval Office after a Presidential Daily Briefing.334 According to Coats, the President asked them whether they could say publicly that no link existed between him and Russia.335 Coats responded that the Office of the Director ofNational Intelligence (ODNJ) has nothing to do with investigations and it was not his role to make a public statement on the Russia investigation.336 Pompeo had no recollection of being asked to stay behind after the March 22 briefing, but he recalled that the President regularly urged officials to get the word out that he had not done anything wrong related to Russia.337 Coats told this Office that the President never asked him to speak to Corney about the FBI investigation.338 Some ODNI staffers, however, had a different recollection of how Coats described the meeting immediately after it occurred. According to senior ODNI official Michael Dempsey, Coats said after the meeting that the President had brought up the Russia investigation and asked him to contact Corney to see if there was a way to get past the investigation, get it over with, end it, or words to that effect.339 Dempsey said that Coats described the President\u0027s comments as falling \"somewhere between musing about hating the investigation\" and wanting Coats to \"do something to stop it.\"340 Dempsey said Coats made it clear that he would not get involved with an ongoing FBI investigation.341 Edward Gistaro, another ODNI official, recalled 331 SC_AD_00210 (Donaldson 3/21/17 Notes); McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 7; Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 19. 332 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 7; Burnham l l/03/17 302, at 11. 333 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 3. 334 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3; Culver 6/14/ I 7 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 13}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_524", "label": "par_524", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterftey Werk Pree1:1et // May CeHtttift Materittl Preteetee Ufteer Fee.

Obstructive act. The evidence shows that, after Corney\u0027s March 20, 2017 testimony, the President repeatedly reached out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss the FBT\u0027s investigation. But witnesses had different recollections of the precise content of those outreaches. Some ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them immediately after the March 22 Oval Office meeting that the President asked Coats to intervene with Corney and \"stop\" the investigation. But the first-hand witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently. Pompeo had no memory of the specific meeting, but generally recalled the President urging officials to get the word out that the President had not done anything wrong related to Russia. Coats recalled that the President asked that Coats state publicly that no link existed between the President and Russia, but did not ask him to speak with Corney or to help end the investigation. The other outreaches by the President during this period were similar in nature: The President asked Rogers if he could do anything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the President asked Corney to make a public statement that would \"lift the cloud\" of the ongoing investigation by making clear that the President was not personally under investigation. These requests, while significant enough that Rogers thought it important to document the encounter in a w\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 10}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_536", "label": "par_536", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e ritten memorandum, were not interpreted by the officials who received them as directives to improperly interfere with the investigation. b. Nexus to a proceeding. At the time of the President\u0027s outreaches to leaders of the intelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation did not yet involve grand jury proceedings. The outreaches, however, came after and were in response to Corney\u0027s March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI, as a part of its counterintelligence mission, was conducting an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Corney testified that the investigation included any links or coordination with Trump campaign officials and would \"include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.\" c. Intent. As described above, the evidence does not establish that the President asked or directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI\u0027s Russia inveand the President affirmatively told Corney that if \"some satellite\" was involved in Russian election interference \"it would be good to find that out.\" But the President\u0027s intent in trying to prevent Sessions\u0027s recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Corney following 380McGahn 12/12/17302,at9-10. 381 Boente 1 /31/18 302, at 7; McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 9. 382 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 7. 60 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_538", "label": "par_538", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e investigate?\" After Corney publicly confirmed the existence of the FBT\u0027s Russia investigation on March 20, 2017, the President was \"beside himself\u0027 and expressed anger that Corney did not issue a statement correcting any misperception that the President himself was under investigation. The President sought to speak with Acting Attorney General Boente directly and told McGahn to contact Boente to request that Corney make a clarifying statement. The President then asked other intelligence community leaders to make public statements to refute the suggestion that the President had links to Russia, but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the investigation. On March 30 and April I I, against the advice of White House advisors who had informed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be perceived as improper interference in an ongoing investigation, the President made personal outreaches to Corney asking him to \"lift the cloud\" of the Russia investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally under investigation. Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true based on Corney\u0027s representations. The President complained to advisors that if people thought Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished. Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia investigation on his ability to govern. The President complained that the perception that he was under investigation was hurting his ability to conduct foreign relations, particularly with Russia. The President told Coats he \"can\u0027t do anything with Russia,\" he told Rogers that \"the thing with the Russians\" was interfering with his ability to conduct foreign affairs, and he told Corney that \"he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult.\" 61 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_539", "label": "par_539", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Al:t:eifflC)\u0027 We,rk Pt2eicluct // May Ce,Ataifl: Matct\u0027ial Pretcctccl Ufl:clct\u0027 Fccl.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) President\u0027s decision to terminate Corney was driven by the recommendations the President received from Rosenstein and Sessions.467 In the morning on May 10, 2017, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office.468 The media subsequently reported that during the May 10 meeting the President brought up his decision the prior day to terminate Corney, telling Lavrov and Kislyak: \"T just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u0027s taken off. ... I\u0027m not under investigation.\"469 The President never denied making those statements, and the White House did not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: \"By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia\u0027s actions, James Corney created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified information.\"470 Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with Lavrov, he did not look concerned and said of Corney, \"he is crazy.\"471 When McGahn asked the President about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Corney was fired because that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he could get more work done.472 That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe.473 According to a memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to 467 See, e.g., Sarah Sanders, White House Daily Briefing, C-SPAN (May 10, 2017); SCR013_001088 (5/10/17 Email, Hemming to Cheung et al.)

It\u0027s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u0027ve won.\"489 In response to a question about whether he was angry with Corney about the Russia investigation, the President said, \"As far as I\u0027m concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly.\"490 The President added that he realized his termination of Corney \"probably maybe will confuse people\" with the result that it \"might even lengthen out the investigation,\" but he \"ha[d] to do the right thing for the American people\" and Corney was \"the wrong man for that position.\"491 The President described Corney as \"a showboat\" and \"a grandstander,\" said that \"[t]he FBI has been in turmoil,\" and said he wanted \"to have a really competent, capable director.\"492 The President affirmed that he expected the new FBI director to continue the Russia investigation.493 On the evening of May 11, 2017, following the Lester Holt interview, the President tweeted, \"Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.\"494 The same day, the media reported that the President had demanded that Corney pledge his loyalty to the President in a private dinner shortly 11. 484 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 16-17; Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 26; see Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 485 Donaldson 11 /6/ 17 302, at 27. 486 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 17. 487 Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 11. 488 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 2. 489 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 2. 490 Interview with President D\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_574", "label": "par_574", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attenatey Werk Preattet // May CeAte:iA Material Pt\u0027eteetea UAaer Fea. R. Criffi. P. 6(e) after being sworn in.495 Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians \u0026 Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.\"496 The President also tweeted, \"James Corney better hope that there are no \u0027tapes\u0027 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\" and \"When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?\"497 Analysis In analyzing the President\u0027s decision to fire Corney, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. The act of firing Corney removed the individual overseeing the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation. The President knew that Corney was personally involved in the investigation based on Corney\u0027s briefing of the Gang of Eight, Corney\u0027s March 20, 2017 public testimony about the investigation, and the President\u0027s one-on-one conversations with Corney. Firing Corney would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect of interfering with or impeding the investigation-for example, if the termination would have the effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity to appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President perceived as more protective of his personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that issue include whether the President\u0027s actions had the potential to discourage a successor director or other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The President fired Corney abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, and criticized him publicly, calling him a \"showboat\" and claiming that the FBI was \"in turmoil\" under his leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were highly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Corney, the President referred to the investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and asked, \"when does it end?\" Those actions had the potential to affect a successor director\u0027s conduct of the investigation. The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director. Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but could not fire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Corney was fired that said, \"The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it.\" Tn addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Corney that the action might prolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to serve as interim director, e\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_578", "label": "par_578", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorae:,\u00b7 Work Proattet // May Coataia Mtt1:erial Proteetee Uaaer Fee.

In the immediate aftermath of the firing, the President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the DOJ recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story. But the President had decided to fire Corney before the White House solicited those recommendations. Although the President ultimately acknowledged that he was going to fire Corney regardless of the Department of Justice\u0027s recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would resist the White House\u0027s suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Corney\u0027s termination. The initial reliance on a pretextual justification could support an inference that the President had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing, although the evidence does not resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or both. E. The President\u0027s Efforts to Remove the Special Counsel Overview The Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting the President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President ultimately did not accept. The President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest, but they responded that those claims were \"ridiculous\" and posed no obstacle to the Special Counsel\u0027s service. Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the Special Counsel\u0027s service. On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President was being personally investigated for obstruction of justice and the President responded with a series of tweets 498 See Volume II, Section II.K. l, infra. 499 See Volume l, Section ITLD.1, supra. 500 In addition to whether the President had a motive related to Russia-related matters that an FBI investigation could uncover, we considered whether the President\u0027s intent in firing Corney was connected to other conduct that could come to light as a result of the FBT\u0027s Russian-interference investigation. In paiticular, Michael Cohen was a potential subject of investigation because of his pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project and involvement in other activities. And facts uncovered in the Russia investigation, which our Office referred to the U.S. Attorney\u0027s Office for the Southern District of New York, ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District ofNew York for campaign-finance offenses related to payments he said he made at the direction of the President. See Volume II, Section II.K.5, infra. The investigation, however, did not establish that when the President fired Corney, he was considering the possibility that the FBI\u0027s investigation would uncover these payments or that the President\u0027s intent in firing Corney was otherwise connected to a concern about these matters coming to light. 77 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_579", "label": "par_579", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atte,me~\u00b7 We,rk Preiettet // M:1:1:y Ceittt1:1:i-H M1:1:teri1:1:I Pre,teetee Uttt:ier Fet:i.

That weekend, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest. McGahn did not carry out the instruction for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday Night Massacre and instead prepared to resign. McGahn ultimately did not quit and the President did not follow up with McGahn on his request to have the Special Counsel removed. Evidence I. The Appointment of the Special Counsel and the President\u0027s Reaction On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rosenstein appointed Robert S. Mueller, ITT as Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the Russia investigation and matters that arose from the investigation.501 The President learned of the Special Counsel\u0027s appointment from Sessions, who was with the President, Hunt, and McGahn conducting interviews for a new FBI Director.502 Sessions stepped out of the Oval Office to take a call from Rosenstein, who told him about the Special Counsel appointment, and Sessions then returned to inform the President of the news.503 According to notes written by Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, \"Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) the Special Counsel. Also during this time period, the President reached out to Christie to get his thoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking an examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a way to terminate the Special Counsel. b. Nexus to an official proceeding. To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would be necessary to establish a nexus between the President\u0027s act of seeking to terminate the Special Counsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding. Substantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal crimes to a grand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the President that his \"biggest exposure\" was not his act of firing Corney but his \"other contacts\" and \"calls,\" and his \"ask re: Flynn.\" By early June, it was widely reported in t}:ie media that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas in the Flynn inquiry and that the Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn investigation.602 On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel\u0027s Office informed the White House that investigators would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedly had been asked by the President to push back against the Russia investigation. On June 14, 2017, news outlets began reporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice. Based on widespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could include his request for Corney\u0027s loyalty; his request that Corney \"let[] Flynn go\"; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and his termination of Corney and statement to the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had relieved \"great pressure\" related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting, \"\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_607", "label": "par_607", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!\" c. Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President\u0027s attempts to remove the Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel\u0027s oversight of investigations that involved the President\u0027s conduct-and, most immediately, to reports that the President was being investigated for potential obstruction of justice. Before the President terminated Corney, the President considered it critically important that he was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being investigated. As described in Volume TI, Section TI.D, supra, advisors perceived the President, while he was drafting the Corney termination letter, to be concerned more than anything else about getting out that he was not personally under investigation. When the President learned of the appointment of the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further concern about the investigation, saying \"[t]his is the end of my Presidency.\" The President also faulted Sessions for recusing, saying \"you were supposed to protect me.\" On June 14, 20 I 7, when the Washington Post reported that the Special Counsel was investigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had wanted 602 See, e.g., Evan Perez et al., CNN exclusive-: Grand jury subpoenas issued in FBJ\u0027s Russia investigation, CNN (May 9, 2017); Matt Ford, Why Mueller Is Taking Over the Michael Flynn Grand Jury, The Atlantic (June 2, 2017). 89 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_608", "label": "par_608", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AtterHe\u0027.\u0027,\" 1Nork Proettet // May CoHtttifl Material Preteetee UHeer Fee. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) to avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of widespread media attention. The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction investigation prompted the President to call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel removed. By mid-June, the Department of Justice had already cleared the Special Counsel\u0027s service and the President\u0027s advisors had told him that the claimed conflicts of interest were \"silly\" and did not provide a basis to remove the Special Counsel. On June 13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good cause for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the President dictated a press statement to Sanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special Counsel. But the next day, the media reported that the President was under investigation for obstruction of justice and the Special Counsel was interviewing witnesses about events related to possible obstruction-spurring the President to write critical tweets about the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation. The President called McGahn at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David. The evidence accordingly indicates that news that an obstruction investigation had been opened is what led the President to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated. There also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made those calls to McGahn. The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told the President that the White House Counsel\u0027s Office-and McGahn himself-could not be involved in pressing conflicts claims and that the President should consult with his personal counsel if he wished to raise conflicts. Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims, the President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel. And after the media reported on the President\u0027s actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in Volume II, Section II.I, infra. Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the President\u0027s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper. F. The President\u0027s Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation Overview Two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only. One month later, the President met again with Lewandowski and followed up on the request to have Sessions limit the scope of the Russia investigation. Lewandowski told the President the message would be delivered soon. Hours later, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an unplanned press interview, raising questions about Sessions\u0027s job security. 1.

But our POTUS ... is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn\u0027t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn\u0027t done anything wrong.

The President Publicly Criticizes Sessions in a New York Times Interview Within hours of the President\u0027s meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he criticized Sessions\u0027s decision to recuse from the Russia investigation.630 The President said that \"Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.\"631 Sessions\u0027s recusal, the President said, was \"very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? Ifhe would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, \u0027Thanks, Jeff, but I can\u0027t, you know, I\u0027m not going to 622 Lewandowski 4/6/18 302, at 5. 623 Lewandowski 4/6/18 302, at 5. 624 Lewandowski 4/6/18 302, at 6.

The President sought to have Sessions announce that the President \"shouldn\u0027t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel\" and that Sessions was going to \"meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.\" The President wanted Sessions to disregard his recusal from the investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ ethics review, and have Sessions declare that he knew \"for a fact\" that \"there were no Russians involved with the campaign\" because he \"was there.\" The President further directed that Sessions should explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation \"because he hasn\u0027t done anything wrong.\" Taken together, the President\u0027s directives indicate that Sessions was being instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation into the President and his campaign, with the Special Counsel being permitted to \"move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections.\" b. Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President\u0027s initial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was ublic knowled e. B the time of the President\u0027s follow-u meetin with Lewandowski, See Volume II, Section 11.G, infra. To satisfy the nexus requirement, it would be necessary to show that limiting the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation would have the natural and probable effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding. c. Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President\u0027s effort to have Sessions limit the scope of the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation to future election interference was intended to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President\u0027s and his campaign\u0027s conduct. As previously described, see Volume TT, Section II.B, supra, the President knew that the Russia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations of Russian interference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election. The President further knew that the investigation had broadened to include his own conduct and whether he had obstructed justice. Those investigations would not proceed if the Special Counsel\u0027s jurisdiction were limited to future election interference only. The timing and circumstances of the President\u0027s actions support the conclusion that he sought that result. The President\u0027s initial direction that Sessions should limit the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation came just two days after the President had ordered McGahn to ~ave the Special Counsel removed, which itself followed public reports that the President was personally under 97 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_622", "label": "par_622", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice A1:t:0rMey Wark Pratlttet // Mtty CaMtttiM Mttterittl Prnteetetl UMeer Fee.

The President raised the matter with Lewandowski again on July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and senior campaign officials had been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media coverage and investigative interest. The manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent. Rather than rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office. The President selected a loyal \"devotee\" outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting an inference that he was working outside White House channels, including McGahn, who had previously resisted contacting the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel. The President also did not contact the Acting Attorney General, who had just testified publicly that there was no cause to remove the Special Counsel. Instead, the President tried to use Sessions to restrict and redirect the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly take any action on it. The July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President\u0027s intent. The President followed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one month after he first dictated the message for Sessions, demonstrating he still sought to pursue the request. And just hours after Lewandowski assured the President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked Sessions and raised questions about his job security. Four days later, on July 22, 2017, the President directed Priebus to obtain Sessions\u0027s resignation. That evidence could raise an inference that the President wanted Sessions to realize that his job might be on the line as he evaluated whether to comply with the President\u0027s direction that Sessions publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal, he was going to confine the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation to future election interference. G. The President\u0027s Efforts to Prevent Disclosure of Emails About the June 9, 2016 Meeting Behveen Russians and Senior Campaign Officials Overview By June 2017, the President became aware of emails setting up the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians who offered derogatory information on Hillary Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government\u0027s support for Mr. Trump.\" On multiple occasions in late June and early July 2017, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails, and he then dictated a statement about the meeting to be issued by Donald Trump Jr. describing the meeting as about adoption. Evidence I. The President Learns About the Existence of Emails Concerning the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower Meeting In mid-June 2017-the same week that the President first asked Lewandowski to pass a message to Sessions-senior Administration officials became aware of emails exchanged during 98 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 12}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_624", "label": "par_624", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e [I]f it\u0027s what you say I love it,\"665 and he, Kushner, and Manafort met with the Russian attorney and several other Russian individuals at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016.666 At the meeting, the Russian attorney claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, and the Russian attorney \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_627", "label": "par_627", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e etaliatory ban in Russia on U.S. adoptions of Russian children.667 According to written answers submitted by the President in response to questions from this Office, the President had no recollection of learning of the meeting or the emails setting it up at the time the meeting occurred or at any other time before the election.668 The Trump Campaign had previously received \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_642", "label": "par_642", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e document request from SSCI that clearly covered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails, and those documents also plainly would have been relevant to the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation. But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special Counsel. The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and prevent their public release occurred in the context of developing a press strategy. The only evidence ,we have of the President discussing the production of documents to Congress or the Special Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when Hicks recalled the President acknowledging that Kushner\u0027s attorney should provide emails related to the June 9 meeting to whomever he needed to give them to. We do not have evidence of what the President discussed with his own lawyers at that time. b. Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President\u0027s attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge, and the President had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the nexus requirement, however, it would be necessary to show that preventing the release of the emails to the public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury proceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted above, the evidence does not establish that the President sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official proceedings. c. intent. The evidence establishes the President\u0027s substantial involvement in the communications strategy related to information about his campaign\u0027s connections to Russia and his desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections. The President became aware of the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner, and he could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017, when lawyers for the Trump Organization began interviewing witnesses who participated in the June 9 meeting.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) dictated a statement to be released by Trump Jr. in response to the first press accounts of the June 9 meeting that said the meeting was about adoption. But as described above, the evidence does not establish that the President intended to prevent the Special Counsel\u0027s Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up the June 9 meeting or other information about that meeting. The statement recorded by Corallo-that the emails \"will never get out\"-can be explained as reflecting a belief that the emails would not be made public if the President\u0027s press strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to Congress and the Special Counsel. H. The President\u0027s Further Efforts to Have the Attorney General Take Over the Investigation Overview From summer 2017 through 2018, the President attempted to have Attorney General Sessions reverse his recusal, take control of the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation, and order an investigation of Hillary Clinton. Evidence 1. The President Again Seeks to Have Sessions Reverse his Recusal After returning Sessions\u0027s resignation letter at the end of May 2017, but before the President\u0027s July 19, 2017 New York Times interview in which he publicly criticized Sessions for recusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessions reverse his recusal. In particular, at some point after the May 17, 2017 appointment of the Special Counsel, Sessions recalled, the President called him at home and asked if Sessions would \"unrecuse\" himself.736 According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the \"gist\" of the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from \"all of it,\" including the Special Counsel\u0027s Russia investigation.737 Sessions listened but did not respond, and he did not reverse his recusal or order an investigation of Clinton.738 In early July 2017, the President asked Staff Secretary Rob Porter what he thought of Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand.739 Porter recalled that the President asked him if Brand was good, tough, and \"on the team.\"740 The President also asked if Porter thought Brand was interested in being responsible for the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation and whether she would want 736 Sessions I /17/18 302, at 15. That was the second time that the President asked Sessions to reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations.

R. Crim. P. 6Ee) to be Attorney General one day.741 Because Pmter knew Brand, the President asked him to sound her out about taking responsibility for the investigation and being Attorney General.742 Contemporaneous notes taken by Porter show that the President told Porter to \"Keep in touch with your friend,\" in reference to Brand.743 Later, the President asked Porter a few times in passing whether he had spoken to Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task.744 In asking him to reach out to Brand, Porter understood the President to want to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel, although the President never said so explicitly.745 Porter did not contact Brand because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the Special Counsel. 746 McGahn recalled that during the summer of 201 7, he and the President discussed the fact that if Sessions were no longer in his position the Special Counsel would report directly to a recused Attorney General.747 McGahn told the President that things might not change much under a new Attorney General.748 McGahn also recalled that in or around July 2017, the President frequently brought up his displeasure with Sessions.749 Hicks recalled that the President viewed Sessions\u0027s recusal from the Russia investigation as an act of disloyalty .750 In addition to criticizing Sessions\u0027s recusal, the President raised other concerns about Sessions and his job performance with McGahn and Hicks.751 741 Porter 4/13/ I 8 302, at 11; Porter 5/8/18 302, at 6. Because of Sessions \u0027s recusal, if Rosenstein were no longer in his position, Brand would, by default, become the DOJ official in charge of supervising the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation, and if both Sessions and Rosenstein were removed, Brand would be next in line to become Acting Attorney General for all DOJ matters.

While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\"773 The next day, the President tweeted a response: \u0027\"Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\u0027 Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the \u0027other side\u0027 including deleted Emails, Corney lies \u0026 leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA abuse, Christopher Steele \u0026 his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump campaign, Russian collusion by Dems -and so much more.

Obstructive act. To determine if the President\u0027s effo11s to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General\u0027s recusal covered (\"Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!\"). 769 @realDonaldTrump 6/5/18 (7:31 a.m. ET) Tweet. 770 @realDonaldTrump 8/1 /18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet. 771 Fox \u0026 Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 772 Fox \u0026 Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). 773 Sessions 8/23/18 Press Statement. 774 @real Donald Trump 8/24/18 (6: 17 a.m. ET) Tweet;@ realDonaldTrump 8/24/18 (6:28 a.m. ET) Tweet. 775 @realDonaldTrump 11/7/18 (2:44 p.m. ET) Tweet.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) other campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not tum on what Attorney General Sessions would actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts to reverse his recusal would naturally have had the effect of impeding the Russia investigation. On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and prosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessions recalled the President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive.

Cohen Determines to Adhere to a \"Party Line\" Distancing Candidate Trump From Russia As previously discussed, see Volume II, Section II.A, supra, when questions about possible Russian support for candidate Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump denied having any personal, financial, or business connection to Russia, which Cohen described as the \"party line\" or \"message\" to follow for Trump and his senior advisors.944 After the election, the Trump Organization sought to formally close out certain deals in advance of the inauguration.945 Cohen recalled that Trump Tower Moscow was on the list of deals to be closed out.946 In approximately January 2017, Cohen began receiving inquiries from the media about Trump Tower Moscow, and he recalled speaking to the President-Elect when those inquiries came in.947 Cohen was concerned that truthful answers about the Trump Tower Moscow project might not be consistent with the \"message\" that the President-Elect had no relationship with Russia.948 In an effort to \"stay on message,\" Cohen told a New York Times reporter that the Trump Tower Moscow deal was not feasible and had ended in January 2016.949 Cohen recalled that this was part of a \"script\" or talking points he had developed with President-Elect Trump and others to 941 Cohen 3/19/19 302, at 2.

Cohen Submits False Statements to Congress Minimizing the Trump Tower Moscow Project in Accordance with the Party Line In early May 2017, Cohen received requests from Congress to provide testimony and documents in connection with congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.953 At that time, Cohen understood Congress\u0027s interest in him to be focused on the allegations in the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russian officials in Prague during the campaign.954 Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.955 On May 18, 2017, Cohen met with the President to discuss the request from Congress, and the President instructed Cohen that he should cooperate because there was nothing there.956 Cohen eventually entered into a joint defense agreement (JOA) with the President and other individuals who were part of the Russia investigation.957 In the months leading up to his congressional testimony, Cohen frequently spoke with the President\u0027s personal counsel.958 Cohen 95\u00b0 Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 5-6. 951 Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 6. 952 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at I 0. 953 P-SCO-000000328 (5/9/17 Letter, HPSCI to Cohen); P-SCO-000000331 (5/12/17 Letter, SSCI to Cohen). 954 Cohen 11/20/18 302, at 2-3. 955 Cohen 11/20/18 302, at 2-3. 956 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 2; Cohen 11/20/19 302, at 3. 957 Cohen 11 /12/18 302, at 2. 958 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 2-3; Cohen 11/20/18\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 9}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_713", "label": "par_713", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterrte,-\u00b7 \\llerk Preettet // Ma,-\u00b7 Certtairt Material Preteetee Urteer Fee.

R. Crim. P. 6(c) Analysis In analyzing the President\u0027s conduct related to Cohen, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice. a. Obstructive act. We gathered evidence of the President\u0027s conduct related to Cohen on two issues: (i) whether the President or others aided or participated in Cohen\u0027s false statements to Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government. i. First, with regard to Cohen\u0027s false statements to Congress, while there is evidence, described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the evidence available to us does not establish that the President directed or aided Cohen\u0027s false testimony. Cohen said that his statements to Congress followed a \"party line\" that developed within the campaign to align with the President\u0027s public statements distancing the President from Russia. Cohen also recalled that, in speaking with the President in advance of testifying, he made it clear that he would stay on message-which Cohen believed they both understood would require false testimony. But Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen\u0027s testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the specifics of his planned testimony. During the time when his statement to Congress was being drafted and circulated to members of the JOA, Cohen did not speak directly to the President about the statement, but rather communicated with the President\u0027s personal counsel-as corroborated by phone records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President\u0027s personal counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before Congress. Cohen recalled that in his discussions with the President\u0027s personal counsel on August 27, 2017-the day before Cohen\u0027s statement was submitted to Congress-Cohen said that there were more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the statement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time. According to Cohen, the President\u0027s personal counsel-who did not have first-hand knowledge of the projectresponded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water, that it was unnecessary to include those details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short and tight, not elaborate, stay on message, and not contradict the President. Cohen\u0027s recollection of the content of those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen\u0027s draft statement that appeared to come from members of the JOA. For example, Cohen omitted any reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the United Nations General Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a decision of of conversations beyond that contained in the President\u0027s [ written responses to the Special Counsel\u0027s Office].\" 2/6/19 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u0027s Office. 153 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_753", "label": "par_753", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AH8f\u0027fl:e~ \u0027.V8rk Pr8E:ittet // May Cm~taifl Material Pr8teeteE:i UHE:ier Fee. R. Crim. P. 6(e) c. Intent. In analyzing the President\u0027s intent in his actions towards Cohen as a potential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen\u0027s information would shed adverse light on the President\u0027s campaign-period conduct and statements. i. Cohen\u0027s false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit the congressional and DOJ Russia investigations-a goal that was in the President\u0027s interest, as reflected by the President\u0027s own statements. During and after the campaign, the President made repeated statements that he had \"no business\" in Russia and said that there were \"no deals that could happen in Russia, because we\u0027ve stayed away.\" As Cohen knew, and as he recalled communicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen\u0027s pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these statements. In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with candidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscow project, that the conversations continued through at least June 2016, and that he discussed with Trump possible travel to Russia to pursue the project. The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, because the project had the potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from Cohen and other records further establish that Cohen\u0027s efforts to advance the project did not end in January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the timing for possible trips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the project. The evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at the time of Cohen\u0027s false statements to Congress. Cohen discussed the project with the President in early 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after he released to the public his opening remarks to Congress-which said the project \"was terminated in January of 2016\"-the President\u0027s personal counsel told him the President was pleased with what Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow. And after Cohen\u0027s guilty plea, the President told reporters tha.t he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which supports the inference that he remained aware of his own involvement in the project and the period during the Campaign in which the project was being pursued. ii. The President\u0027s public remarks following Cohen\u0027s guilty plea also suggest that the President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project. At the time the President submitted written answers to questions from this Office about the project and other subjects, the media \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_756", "label": "par_756", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e Even if [Cohen] was right, it doesn\u0027t matter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.\" As described above, there is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect the President and minimize the President\u0027s connections to Russia during the campaign. iv. Finally, the President\u0027s statements insinuating that members of Cohen\u0027s family committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed as an effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen or others. It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen \"ma[d]e[] up stories\" in order to get a deal for himself and \"get his wife and father-in-law ... off Scott Free.\" It also is possible that the President\u0027s mention of Cohen\u0027s wife and father-in-law were not intended to affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy aimed at discrediting Cohen and deflecting attention away from the President on Cohen-related matters. But the President\u0027s suggestion that Cohen\u0027s family members committed crimes happened more than once, including just before Cohen was sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen \"should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence\") and again just before Cohen was scheduled to testify before Congress. The timing of the statements supports an inference that they were intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from further cooperation. L. Overarching Factual Issues Although this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination decision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts concerning the President\u0027s course of conduct. 1. Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland obstructionjustice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice. First, the conduct involved actions by the President. Some of the conduct did not implicate the President\u0027s constitutional authority and raises garden-variety obstruction-of-justice issues. Other events we investigated, however, drew upon the President\u0027s Article II authority, which raised constitutional issues that we address in Volume II, Section III.B, infra. A factual analysis of that conduct would have to take into account both that the President\u0027s acts were facially lawful and that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings, s\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_758", "label": "par_758", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atter11ey Werk Preettet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteetee U11eer Fee. R. Cril\u0027H. P. 6(e) Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying crime. Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper obstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that he contemplated an effect on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 591 (2d Cir. 2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction offense. See United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017) (stating, in applying the obstruction sentencing guideline, that \"obstruction of a criminal investigation is punishable even if the prosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying crime\"). Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong. In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President\u0027s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events-such as advance notice of WikiLeaks\u0027s release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family. Third, many of the President\u0027s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a corrupt intent, the President\u0027s power to influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his unique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications. And no principle of law excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony, the justice system\u0027s integrity is equally threatened. 2. Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts-e.g., the President\u0027s statement to Corney about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Corney, and his efforts to remove the Special Counsel-it is important to view the President\u0027s pattern of conduct as a whole. That pattern sheds light on the nature of the President\u0027s acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. a. Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exetting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General\u0027s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony. Viewing the acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance. For example, the President\u0027s direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by his direction to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia investigation to prospective election-interference only-a temporal connection that suggests that both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation. 157 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_759", "label": "par_759", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atte,rttey Werk Pre,tlttet // May Ce,tttaiH Material Pre,teetetl UHtler Fee. R. Crim. P. 6(e) The President\u0027s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Corney did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn\u0027s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President\u0027s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President\u0027s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President\u0027s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President\u0027s multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President\u0027s aides and associates beyond those already filed. b. In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President\u0027s actions can be divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President\u0027s motives. In the first phase, before the President fired Corney, the President had been assured that the FBI had not opened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically important to make public that he was not under investigation, and he included that information in his termination letter to Corney after other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful. Soon after he fired Corney, however, the President became aware that investigators were conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked a significant change in the President\u0027s conduct and the start of a second phase of action. The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance, the President attempted to remove the Special Counsel; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the investigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the government.

If yes, describe the source(s) of the information, when you were informed, and the content of such discussion(s). Response to Question l, Parts (a) through (c) I have no recollection of learning at the time that Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner was considering participating in a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially negative information about Hillary Clinton. Nor do I recall learning during the campaign that the June 9, 2016 meeting had taken place, that the referenced emails existed. or that Donald J. Trump, Jr., had other communications with Emin Agalarov or Robert Goldstone between June 3, 2016 and June 9, 2016. Response to Question I, Part {d) I have no independent recollection of what portion of these four days in June of2016 I spent in Trump Tower. This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign, as the primary season was ending and we were preparing for the general election campaign. I am now aware that my Campaign\u0027s calendar indicates that I was in New York City from June 6 -9, 2016. Calendars kept in my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various calls and meetings scheduled for each of these days. While those calls and meetings may or may not actually have taken place, they do indicate that I was in Trump Tower during a portion of each of these working days, and I have no reason to doubt that I was. When I was in New York City, I stayed at my Trump Tower apartment. My Trump Organization desk calendar also reflects that I was outside Trump Tower during portions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower in the early evening for Westchester where I gave remarks after winning the California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day. The June 8, 2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in late afternoon to attend a ceremony at my son\u0027s school. The June 9, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to attend midday meetings and a fundraising luncheon at the Four Seasons Hotel. At this point, I do not remember on what dales these events occurred, but I do not currently have a reason to doubt that they took place as scheduled on my calendar. Widely available media reports, including television footage, also shed light on my activities during these days.

Response to Question III, Parts (a) through (g) Sometime in 2015, Michael Cohen suggested to me the possibility of a Trump Organization project in Moscow.

I signed the non-binding Letter of Intent attached to your questions as Exhibit B which required no equity or expenditure on our end and was consistent with our ongoing efforts to expand into significant markets around the world.

The two shook hands and chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner recalled Kislyak saying, \"we like what your candidate is saying ... it\u0027s refreshing.\"628 Several public reports state that, in addition to speaking to Kushner at the pre-speech reception, Kislyak also met or conversed with Sessions at that time.629 Sessions stated to investigators, however, that he did not remember any such conversation.630 Nor did anyone else affiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between Sessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception.631 It appears that, if a conversation occurred at the pre-speech reception, it was a brief one conducted in public view, similar to the exchange between Kushner and Kislyak. 619 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 11-12; C00006651-57 (Mayflower Group Sales Agreement). 620 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 12-13. 621 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 12. 622 C00002575 (Attendee List); C00008536 (4/25/16 Email, Simes to Kushner (4:53:45 p.m.)). 623 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 19-20. 624 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. 625 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. 626 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. 627 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. 628 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 4. 629 See, e.g., Ken Dilanian, Did Trump, Kushner, Sessions Have an Undisclosed Meeting With Russian?, NBC News (June 1, 2016); Julia Ioffe, Why Did Jeff Sessions Really Meet With Sergey Kislyak, The Atlantic (June 13, 2017). 630 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22. 631 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 14, 21; Boyd 1/24/18 302, at 3-4; Heilbrunn 2/1/18 302, at 6; Statement Regarding President Trump\u0027s April 27, 2016 Foreign Policy Speech at the Center for the National Interest, CNI (Mar. 8, 2017). 106 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 14}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_264", "label": "par_264", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AUem.ey Wet\u00b7lc Pt\u0027edt1et // May Centain Material Preteeted Under Fed.

Events at the Republican National Convention Trump Campaign officials met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention. The evidence indicates that those interactions were brief and non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately before the Convention, J.D. Gordon, a senior Campaign advisor on policy and national security, diluted a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing \"lethal\" assistance to Ukraine in response to Russian aggression. Gordon requested that platform committee personnel revise the proposed amendment to state that only \"appropriate\" assistance be provided to Ukraine. The original sponsor of the \"lethal\" assistance amendment stated that Gordon told her (the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his request to dilute the language. Gordon denied making that statement to the sponsor, although he acknowledged it was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the subject matter. The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the candidate to make that proposal. Gordon said that he sought the change because he believed the proposed language was inconsistent with Trump\u0027s position on Ukraine. a.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) time to issue a correction for a news story-indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings arising from it. c. Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn \u0027s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President\u0027s conduct towards the investigation. Several facts support that conclusion. The President made repeated attempts to get McGahn to change his story. As described above, by the time of the last attempt, the evidence suggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President had ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated. McGahn interpreted his encounter with the President in the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he was to his memory of what had occurred. The President had already laid the groundwork for pressing McGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might be necessary to fire McGahn if he did not deny the story, and Porter relayed that statement to McGahn. Additional evidence of the President\u0027s intent may be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the prospect of the President\u0027s meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn\u0027s counsel and said that McGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the Oval Office that day. The President\u0027s counsel was well aware ofMcGahn\u0027s resolve not to issue what he believed to be a false account of events despite the President\u0027s request. Finally, as noted above, the President brought up the Special Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahn and criticized him for telling this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President\u0027s statements reflect his understanding-and his displeasure-that those events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice inquiry. J. The President\u0027s Conduct Towards Flynn, Manafort, Overview In addition to the interactions with McGahn described above, the President has taken other actions directed at possible witnesses in the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation, including Flynn, Manafort, %\u20acas described in the next section, Cohen. When Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President, the President\u0027s personal counsel stated that Flynn\u0027s actions would be viewed as reflecting \"hostility\" towards the President. During Manafort\u0027s prosecution and while the jury was deliberating, the President repeatedly stated that Manafott was bein treated unfair! and made it known that Mana fort could receive a ardon. Evidence I . Conduct Directed at Michael Flynn As previously noted, see Volume II, Section 11.B, supra, the President asked for Flynn\u0027s resignation on February 13, 2017.

Cohen told investigators about his conversations with the President\u0027s personal counsel after waiving any privilege of his own and after this Office advised his counsel not to provide any communications that would be covered by any other privilege, including communications protected by a joint defense or common interest privilege. As a result, most of what Cohen told us about his conversations with the President\u0027s personal counsel concerned what Cohen had communicated to the President\u0027s personal counsel, and not what was said in response. Cohen described certain statements made by the President\u0027s personal counsel, however, that are set forth in this section. Cohen and his counsel were better positioned than this Office to evaluate whether any privilege protected those statements because they had knowledge of the scope of their joint defense agreement and access to privileged communications that may have provided context for evaluating the statements they shared.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) the IDA to delete the sentence, \"The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian government officials.\" The President\u0027s personal counsel declined to provide us with his account of his conversations with Cohen, and there is no evidence available to us that indicates that the President was aware of the information Cohen provided to the President\u0027s personal counsel. The President\u0027s conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-client privilege, and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications. The absence of evidence about the President and his counsel\u0027s conversations about the drafting of Cohen\u0027s statement precludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played. ii. Second, we considered whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal investigators or to Congress. Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately urged Cohen to stay on message and not \"flip.\" Cohen recalled the President\u0027s personal counsel telling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go \"rogue.\" In the days and weeks that fol lowed the Apri 1 2018 searches of Cohen\u0027s home and office, the President told reporters that Cohen was a \"good man\" and said he was \"a fine person with a wonderful family ... who I have always liked \u0026 respected.\" Privately, the President told Cohen to \"hang in there\" and \"stay strong.\" People who were close to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohen that \"the President loves you,\" \"the boss loves you,\" and \"everyone knows the boss has your back.\" Through the President\u0027s personal counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen \"thanks for what you do\" after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that, according to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew was false. At that time, the Trump Organization continued to pay Cohen\u0027s legal fees, which was important to Cohen. Cohen also recalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the President\u0027s personal counsel, who told him to stay on message and everything would be fine. The President indicated in his public statements that a pardon had not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that \"[m]ost people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble\" but that he \"d[idn\u0027t] see Michael doing that.\" After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however, the President accused Cohen of \"mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?),\" called Cohen a \"rat,\" and on multiple occasions publicly suggested that Cohen\u0027s family members had committed crimes. The evidence concerning this sequence of events could suppot1 an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the provision of information or undermine Cohen\u0027s credibility once Cohen began cooperating. b.

Accordingly, it was not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided to the government. In his written answers, the President did not provide details about the timing and substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no indication that he had decided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly stated that he had personally made the decision to abandon the project. The President then declined to clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content and timing of the President\u0027s provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concerned about the information that Cohen could provide as a witness. 155 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 1}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_755", "label": "par_755", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attoff\\e)\" Wodc Pfoelttet // Mtt)\" CoHtttiA Materittl Proteeteel UHeer Feel.

The President\u0027s concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed at the Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the President\u0027s dealings with Cohen rather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow. There also is some evidence that the President\u0027s concern about Cohen cooperating was based on the President\u0027s stated belief that Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in an attempt to obtain a lesser sentence for his unrelated criminal conduct. The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, refused to \"break\" and \"make up stories in order to get a \u0027deal.\"\u0027 And after Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, the President said, \"what [Cohen]\u0027s trying to do is get a reduced sentence.

Flynn\u0027s Resignation On February 2, 2017, Eisenberg reviewed the underlying information relating to Flynn\u0027s calls with Kislyak.189 Eisenberg recalled that he prepared a memorandum about criminal statutes that could apply to Flynn\u0027s conduct, but he did not believe the White House had enough information to make a definitive recommendation to the President.190 Eisenberg and McGahn discussed that Eisenberg\u0027s review of the underlying information confirmed his preliminary conclusion that Flynn was unlikely to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act.I9I Because White House officials were uncertain what Flynn had told the FBI, however, they could not assess his exposure to prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.192 The week of February 6, Flynn had a one-on-one conversation with the President in the Oval Office about the negative media coverage of his contacts with Kislyak.I93 Flynn recalled that the President was upset and asked him for information on the conversations.194 Flynn listed the specific dates on which he remembered speaking with Kislyak, but the President corrected one of the dates he listed.I95 The President asked Flynn what he and Kislyak discussed and Flynn responded that he might have talked about sanctions.I96 memorandum documenting the dinner to his senior leadership team, and McCabe confirmed that the memorandum captured what Corney said on the telephone call immediately following the dinner. McCabe 8/17/17 302, at 9-10. 188 There also is evidence that corroborates other aspects of the memoranda Corney wrote documenting his interactions with the President. For example, Corney recalled, and his memoranda reflect, that he told the President in his January 6, 2017 meeting, and on phone calls on March 30 and April 11, 2017, that the FBI was not investigating the President personally. On May 8, 2017, during White House discussions about firing Corney, the President told Rosenstein and others that Corney had told him three times that he was not under investigation, including once in person and twice on the phone.

R:. Criffl. P. 6(e) C. Russian Government Outreach and Contacts As explained in Section IV above, the Office\u0027s investigation uncovered evidence of numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above-with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine. One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on Hillary Clinton-implicates an additional body of law: campaignfinance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As ex lained below, the Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russiaaffiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct the Office\u0027s investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice. 1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of \"collusion,\" but through the lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[ e ]\" appears in the Acting Attorney General\u0027s August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown \u0026 Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. See Black\u0027s Law Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is \"[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law\"); 1 Alexander Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) (\"An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.\"); 1 Bouvier\u0027s Law Dictionary 352 180 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 13}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_611", "label": "par_611", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AttarAey Wark Pt\u0141asttet // May CaHtttiH Material Prateetes UAser Fee.

The President Follows Up with Lewandowski Following his June meeting with the President, Lewandowski contacted Rick Dearborn, then a senior White House official, and asked if Dearborn could pass a message to Sessions.618 Dearborn agreed without knowing what the message was, and Lewandowski later confirmed that Dearborn would meet with Sessions for dinner in late July and could deliver the message then.619 Lewandowski recalled thinking that the President had asked him to pass the message because the President knew Lewandowski could be trusted, but Lewandowski believed Dearborn would be a better messenger because he had a longstanding relationship with Sessions and because Dearborn was in the government while Lewandowski was not.620 On July 19, 2017, the President again met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office.621 In the preceding days, as described in Volume IT, Section ILG, infra, emails and other information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between several Russians and Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort had been publicly disclosed.

At that time, Giuliani had recently suggested to reporters that the Special Counsel investigation needed to be \"done in the next two or three weeks,\"868 and media stories reported that a Manafort acquittal would add to criticism that the Special Counsel investigation was not worth the time and expense, whereas a conviction could show that ending the investigation would be premature.869 861 State of the Union with Jake Tapper Transcript, CNN (June 17, 2018). 862 See, e.g., Katelyn Polantz, Takeaways from day one of the Paul Manafort trial, CNN (July 31, 2018); Frank Bruni, Paul Manafort \u0027s Trial Is Donald Trump\u0027s, Too, New York Times Opinion (July 31, 2018); Rachel Weiner et al., Paul Manafort trial Day 2: Witnesses describe extravagant clothing purchases, home remodels, lavish cars paid with wire transfers, Washington Post (Aug. 1, 2018). 863 @realDonaldTrump 8/1/18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet.

We did not find counsel\u0027s contention, however, to accord with our reading of the Supreme Court authority addressing powers issues. Applying the Court\u0027s framework for analysis, we concluded that Congress can validly regulate the President\u0027s exercise of official duties to prohibit actions motivated by a corrupt intent to obstruct justice. The limited effect on presidential power that results from that restriction would not impermissibly undermine the President\u0027s ability to perform his Article II functions. 1.

Trump hired him at that time.877 Manafort agreed to work on the Campaign without pay. Manafort had no meaningful income at this point in time, but resuscitating his domestic political campaign career could be financially beneficial in the future. Gates reported that Manafort intended, if Trump won the Presidency, to remain outside the Administration and monetize his relationship with the Administration. 878 ii. Paul Manafort\u0027s Campaign-Period Contacts Immediately upon joining the Campaign, Manafort directed Gates to prepare for his review separate memoranda addressed to Deripaska, Akhmetov, Serhiy Lyovochkin, and Boris Kolesnikov,879 the last three being Ukrainian oligarchs who were senior Opposition Bloc officials. 880 The memoranda described Manafort\u0027 s appointment to the Trump Campaign and indicated his willingness to consult on Ukrainian politics in the future.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) II. RUSSIAN \"ACTIVE MEASURES\" SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The first form of Russian election influence came principally from the Internet Research Agency, LLC (IRA), a Russian organization funded by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and companies he controlled, including Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering (collectively \"Concord\").2 The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large U.S. audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system.3 These operations constituted \"active measures\" (aKTMBHbie Meporrprumu1), a term that typically refers to operations conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs.4 The IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as 2014. Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over time, these social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences. IRA employees travelled to the United States in mid-2014 on an intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and photographs for use in their social media posts. IRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political rallies.5 The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA\u0027s interference operation. By the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and 2 The Office is aware of reports that other Russian entities engaged in similar active measw-es operations targeting the United States. Some evidence collected by the Office corroborates those rep01ts, and the Office has shared that evidence with other offices in the Department of Justice and FBI. 3 Harm to Ongoing Matter see also SM-2230634, serial 44 (analysis). The FBI case number cited here, and other FBI case numbers identified in the report, should be treated as law enforcement sensitive given the context. The report contains additional law enforcement sensitive information. 4 As discussed in Part V below, the active measures investigation has resulted in criminal charges against 13 individual Russian nationals and three Russian entities, principally for conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.

U.S. Operations Involving Political Rallies The IRA organized and promoted political rallies inside the United States while posing as U.S. grassroots activists.

Although the defendant must act on behalf of a foreign government (as opposed to other kinds of foreign entities), the acts need not involve espionage; rather, acts of any type suffice for liability.

The statute does not require willfulness, and knowledge of the notification requirement is not an element of the offense. United States v. Campa, 529 F.3d 980, 998-99 (11th Cir. 2008); Duran, 596 F.3d at 1291-94; Dumeisi, 424 F.3d at 581. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) generally makes it illegal to act as an agent of a foreign principal by engaging in certain (largely political) activities in the United States without registering with the Attorney General. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 611-621. The triggering agency relationship must be with a foreign principal or \"a person any of whose activities are directly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a foreign principal.\" 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 61 l(c)(l). That includes a foreign government or political party and various foreign individuals and entities. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(6). A covered relationship exists if a person \"acts as an agent, representative, employee, or servant\" or \"in any other capacity at the order, request, or under the [foreign principal\u0027s] direction or control.\" 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 61 l(c)(l).

The nexus inquiry articulated in Aguilar-that an individual has \"knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding,\" 515 U.S. at 599-does not apply to Section 1512(6)(3). See United States v. Byrne, 435 F .3d I 6, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2006). The nexus inquiry turns instead on the actor\u0027s intent to prevent communications to a federal law enforcement official. See Fowler v. United States, 563 U.S. 668, 673-678 (2011 ). * * * In sum, in light of the breadth of Section 1512( c )(2) and the other obstruction statutes, an argument that the conduct at issue in th is investigation falls outside the scope of the obstruction laws lacks merit. B. Constitutional Defenses to Applying Obstruction-Of-Justice Statutes to Presidential Conduct The President has broad discretion to direct criminal investigations. The Constitution vests the \"executive Power\" in the President and enjoins him to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" U.S. CONST. ART IT, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3. Those powers and duties form the foundation of prosecutorial discretion. See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (Attorney General and United States Attorneys \"have this latitude because they are designated by statute as the President\u0027s delegates to help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to \u0027take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\"\u0027). The President also has authority to appoint officers of the United States and to remove those whom he has appointed. U.S. CONST. ART II,\u00a7 2, cl. 2 (granting authority to the President to appoint all officers with the advice and consent of the Senate, but providing that Congress may vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President alone, the heads of departments, or the courts of law); see also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 492-493, 509 (2010) (describing removal authority as flowing from the President\u0027s \"responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed\"). Although the President has broad authority under Article II, that authority coexists with Congress\u0027s Article I power to enact laws that protect congressional proceedings\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_777", "label": "par_777", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e , federal investigations, the courts, and grand juries against corrupt efforts to undermine their functions. Usually, those constitutional powers function in harmony, with the President enforcing the criminal laws under Article IT to protect against corrupt obstructive acts. But when the President\u0027s official actions come into conflict with the prohibitions in the obstruction statutes, any constitutional tension is reconciled through separation-of-powers analysis. Whoever corruptly ... influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress. 168 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 1}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_797", "label": "par_797", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e the power to protect the judiciary against obstructive acts. See U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 8, els. 9, 18 (\"The Congress shall have Power ... To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court\" and \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers\"). The long lineage of the obstruction-of-justice statutes, which can be traced to at least 183 I, attests to the necessity for that protection. See An Act Declaratory of the Law Concerning Contempts of Court, 4 Stat. 487-488 \u00a7 2 (1831) (making it a crime if\"any person or persons shall corruptly ... endeavor to influence, intimidate, or impede any juror, witness, or officer, in any court of the United States, in the discharge of his duty, or shall, corruptly ... obstruct, or impede, or endeavor to obstruct or impede, the due administration of justice therein\"). ii. The Article TII courts have an equally strong interest in being protected against obstructive acts, whatever their source. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon, a \"primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch\" is \"to do justice in criminal prosecutions.\" 418 U.S. at 707; accord Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 384 (2004). In Nixon, the Court rejected the President\u0027s claim of absolute executive privilege because \"the allowance of the privilege to withhold evidence that is demonstrably 1089 The obstruction statutes do not disqualify the President from acting in a case simply because he has a personal interest in it or because his own conduct may be at issue. As the Department of Justice has made clear, a claim of a conflict of interest, standing alone, cannot deprive the President of the ability to fulfill his constitutional function. See, e.g., OLC, Application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 O.L.C. Op. at 356 (citing Memorandum for Richard T.

P. 6(e) APPENDIXD SPECIAL COUNSEL\u0027S OFFICE TRANSFERRED, REFERRED, AND COMPLETED CASES This appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the Special Counsel\u0027s Office, as well as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed. A. Transfers The Special Counsel\u0027s Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain matters assigned to the Office by the Acting Attorney General have not fully concluded as of the date of this report. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those matters to other components of the Department of Justice and the FBI. Those transfers include: 1. United States v. Bijan Rafiekian and Kami! Ekim Alptekin US. Attorney\u0027s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia (Awaiting trial) The Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other things, possible criminal conduct by Michael Flynn in acting as an unregistered agent for the Government of Turkey. See August 2, 2017 Memorandum from Rod J. Rosenstein to Robert S. Mueller, III. The Acting Attorney General later confirmed the Special Counsel\u0027s authority to investigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they \"may have been jointly involved\" with Flynn in FARA-related crimes. See October 20, 2017 Memorandum from Associate Deputy Attorney General Scott Schools to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. On December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to an Information charging him with making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. As part of that plea, Flynn agreed to a Statement of the Offense in which he acknowledged that the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) documents he filed on March 7, 2017 \"contained materially false statements and omissions.\" Flynn\u0027s plea occurred before the Special Counsel had made a final decision on whether to charge Rafiekian or Alptekin. On March 27, 2018, after consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Special Counsel\u0027s Office referred the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin to the National Security Division (NSD) for any action it deemed appropriate.

R. Crim. P. 6Ec) First, Corney wrote a detailed memorandum of his encounter with the President on the same day it occurred. Corney also told senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President that day, and their recollections of what Corney told them at the time are consistent with Corney\u0027s account.271 Second, Corney provided testimony about the President\u0027s request that he \"let[] Flynn go\" under oath in congressional proceedings and in interviews with federal investigators subject to penalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 I 00 l. Corney\u0027s recollections of the encounter have remained consistent over time. Third, the objective, corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting came to occur support Corney\u0027s description of the event. Corney recalled that the President cleared the room to speak with Corney alone after a homeland security briefing in the Oval Office, that Kushner and Sessions lingered and had to be shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly opened the door during the meeting, prompting the President to wave him away. While the President has publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have confirmed Corney\u0027s account of how he ended up in a one-on-one meeting with the President.272 And the President acknowledged to Priebus and McGahn that he in fact spoke to Corney about Flynn in their one-on-one meeting. Fourth, the President\u0027s decision to clear the room and, in particular, to exclude the Attorney General from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with Corney, which is consistent with the delivery of a message of the type that Corney recalls, rather than a more innocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the Attorney General. Finally, Corney\u0027s reaction to the President\u0027s statements is consistent with the President having asked him to \"let[] Flynn go.\" Corney met with the FBI leadership team, which agreed to keep the President\u0027s statements closely held and not to inform the team working on the Flynn investigation so that they would not be influenced by the President\u0027s request. Corney also promptly met with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left alone with the President again, an account verified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney General\u0027s chief of staff. A second question is whether the President\u0027s statements, which were not phrased as a direct order to Corney, could impede or interfere with the FBI\u0027s investigation of Flynn. While the President said he \"hope[d]\" Corney could \"let[] Flynn go,\" rather than affirmatively directing him to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Corney to close the FBl\u0027s investigation into Flynn. First, the President arranged the meeting with Corney so that they would be alone and purposely excluded the Attorney General, which suggests that the President meant to make a request to Corney that he did not want anyone else to hear. Second, because the President is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he \"hopes\" a subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the President wants. Indeed, the President repeated a version of\"let this go\" three times, and Corney 271 Rybicki 11/21/18 302, at 4; McCabe 8/17/17 302, at 13-14. 272 See Priebus I 0/13/17 302, at 18; Sessions I /17/18 302, at 6. 45 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 11}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_595", "label": "par_595", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attemey Werk Predttct // May Cefl:taifl: Material Prntcctcd Ufl:der Fed.

National Interest Hosts a Foreign Policy Speech at the Mayflower Hotel During both their March 24 phone call and their March 31 in-person meeting, Simes and Kushner discussed the possibility of CNI hosting a foreign policy speech by candidate Trump.611 Following those conversations, Simes agreed that he and others associated with CNI would provide behind-the-scenes input on the substance of the foreign-policy speech and that CNI officials would coordinate the logistics of the speech with Sessions and his staff, including Sessions\u0027s chief of staff, Rick Dearborn.612 In mid-April 2016, Kushner put Simes in contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller and forwarded to Simes an outline of the foreign-policy speech that Miller had prepared.613 Simes sent back to the Campaign bullet points with ideas for the speech that he had drafted with CNI Executive Director Paul Saunders and board member Richard Burt.614 Simes received subsequent draft outlines from Miller, and he and Saunders spoke to Miller by phone about substantive changes to the speech.615 It is not clear, however, whether CNI officials received an actual draft of the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actual draft, Simes did not, and the emails that CNI produced to this Office do not contain such a draft.616 After board members expressed concern to Simes that CNl\u0027s hosting the speech could be perceived as an endorsement of a particular candidate, CNI decided to have its publication, the National Interest, serve as the host and to have the event at the National Press Club.617 Kushner later requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was another venue that Simes had mentioned during initial discussions with the Campaign, in order to address concerns about security and capacity.618 61\u00b0 C00008187 (6/17/16 Email, Simes to Gordon (3:35:45 p.m.)). 611 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 7. 612 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 8-11; C00008923 (4/6/16 Email, Simes to Burt (2:22:28 p.m.)); Burt 2/9/18 302, at 7. 613 C00008551 (4/17/16 Email, Kushner to Simes (2:44:25 p.m.)); C00006759 (4/14/16 Email Kushner to Simes \u0026 S.

Our best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been served content from a Page associated with the IRA at some point during the two-year period.\"). The Facebook representative also testified that Facebook had identified 170 Instagram accounts that posted approximately 120,000 pieces of content during that time.

Kushner told the Office that the meeting was diplomatic, with Gorkov expressing disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for improved relations with the incoming Administration.1157 According to Kushner, although Gorkov told Kushner a little bit about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy, the two did not discuss Kushner\u0027s companies or private business dealings of any kind.1158 (At the time of the meeting, Kushner Companies had a debt obligation coming due on the building it owned at 666 Fifth Avenue, and there had been public reporting both about efforts to secure lending on the property and possible conflicts of interest for Kushner arising out of his company\u0027s borrowing from foreign lenders. 1159) In contrast, in a 2017 public statement, VEB suggested Gorkov met with Kushner in Kushner\u0027 s capacity as CEO of Kushner Companies for the purpose of discussing business, rather than as part of a diplomatic effort. In particular, VEB characterized Gorkov\u0027s meeting with Kushner as part of a series of \"roadshow meetings\" with \"representatives of major US banks and business circles,\" which included \"negotiations\" and discussion of the \"most promising business lines and sectors.\"1160 Foresman, the investment bank executive mentioned in Volume l, Sections IV.A. \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_616", "label": "par_616", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice At:terl\u0027l.ey \u0027Herlc Preettet // Ma)\u0027\u0027 Cel\u0027l.tail\u0027I.

In any event, probing the President\u0027s intent in a criminal matter is unquestionably constitutional in at least one context: the offense of bribery turns on the corrupt intent to receive a thing of value in return for being influenced in official action. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 20l(b)(2). There can be no serious argument against the President\u0027s potential criminal liability for bribery offenses, notwithstanding the need to ascertain his purpose and intent. See U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 3; ART. IT, \u00a7 4; see also Application of 28 US. C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op.

Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling effect justifies exempting the President from the obstruction laws. As a historical matter, Presidents have very seldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations. And it is rarer still for circumstances to raise even the possibility of a corrupt personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the President\u0027s use of official power. Accordingly, the President\u0027s conduct of office should not be chilled based on hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt-motive standard in this context. * * \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 2}, {"color": "Black", "id": "social media", "label": "social media", "shape": "dot", "title": "social media", "value": 31}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_59", "label": "par_59", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attertte, Werk Pred1:1et // Mtty Cetttttifl Mttterittl Prnteeted Under Fed.

In certain cases, the IRA created accounts that mimicked real U.S. organizations. For example, one IRA-controlled Twitter account, @TEN_ GOP, purported to be connected to the Tennessee Republican Party.46 More commonly, the IRA created accounts in the names of fictitious U.S. organizations and grassroots groups and used these accounts to pose as immigration groups, Tea Party activists, Black Lives Matter protestors, and other U.S. social and political activists.

The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel\u0027s Office found to be supp01ted by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts. In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[ e ]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation\u0027s scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office\u0027s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign \"coordinat[ ed]\"-a term that appears in the appointment order-with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement-tacit or express-between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other\u0027s actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. * * * \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "Black", "id": "conspiracy", "label": "conspiracy", "shape": "dot", "title": "conspiracy", "value": 19}, {"color": "Black", "id": "collusion", "label": "collusion", "shape": "dot", "title": "collusion", "value": 11}, {"color": "Blue", "id": "the United States Code", "label": "the United States Code", "shape": "dot", "title": "the United States Code", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_216", "label": "par_216", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e obvious that he wants to earn lots of money.\"529 Podobnyy said that he had led Page on by \"feed[ing] him empty promises\" that Podobnyy would use his Russian business connections to help Page.530 Podobnyy told the other intelligence officer that his method of recruiting foreign sources was to promise them favors and then discard them once he obtained relevant information from them.531 In 2015, Podobnyy and two other Russian intelligence officers were charged with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign government.532 The criminal complaint detailed Podobnyy\u0027s interactions with and conversations about Page, who was identified only as \"Male-1.\"533 Based on the criminal complaint\u0027s description of the interactions, Page was aware that he was the individual described as \"Male-l.\"534 Page later spoke with a Russian government \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_383", "label": "par_383", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Prod1:1et // Ma,\u00b7 Cmnain Material Proteeted Under Fed. R. Criffi. P. 6(e) did not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law. Given his less direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has not developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues. iii. Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information The Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(l). The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions-such as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost or the cost of distribution-would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting. Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that the information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy may well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, see, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485,489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone\u0027s description of the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the information\u0027s value-i.e., that it would \"incriminate Hillary\" and \"would be very useful to [Trump Jr.\u0027s] father\"-was specific and may have been understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given Goldstone\u0027s lack of direct access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be delivered could be reflected in Trump Jr.\u0027s response (\"if it\u0027s what you say I love it\") (emphasis added). Accordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting. c.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) earlier provision is instructive. Recognizing that \"the proper administration of justice may be impeded or thwarted\" by a \"variety of corrupt methods ... limited only by the imagination of the criminally inclined,\" S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (1982), Congress considered a bill that would have amended Section 1512 by making it a crime, inter alia, when a person \"corruptly ... influences, obstructs, or impedes ... [t]he enforcement and prosecution of federal law,\" \"administration of a law under which an official proceeding is being or may be conducted,\" or the \"exercise of a Federal legislative power of inquiry.\" Id. at 17-19 ( quoting S. 2420). The Senate Committee explained that: [T]he purpose of preventing an obstruction of or miscarriage of justice cannot be fully carried out by a simple enumeration of the commonly prosecuted obstruction offenses. There must also be protection against the rare type of conduct that is the product of the inventive criminal mind and which also thwarts justice. Id. at 18. The report gave examples of conduct \"actually prosecuted under the current residual clause [in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503], which would probably not be covered in this series [of provisions] without a residual clause.\" Id. One prominent example was \"[a] conspiracy to cover up the Watergate burglary and its aftermath by having the Central Intelligence Agency seek to interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation of the burglary.\" Id. (citing United States v. Haldeman, 559 F.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976)). The report therefore indicates a congressional awareness not only that residual-clause language resembling Section 1512( c )(2) broadly covers a wide variety of obstructive conduct, but also that such language reaches the improper use of governmental processes to obstruct justice-specifically, the Watergate cover-up orchestrated by White House officials including the President himself. See Haldeman, 559 F .3d at 51, 86-87, 120-129, 162.1081 4. General Principles of Statutory Construction Do Not Suggest That Section 1512(c)(2) is Inapplicable to the Conduct in this Investigation The requirement of fair warning in criminal law, the interest in avoiding due process concerns in potentially vague statutes, and the rule of lenity do not justify narrowing the reach of Section 1512( c )(2)\u0027 s text. 1082 a. As with other criminal laws, the Supreme Court has \"exercised restraint\" in interpreting obstruction-of-justice provisions, both out ofrespect for Congress\u0027s role in defining crimes and in the interest of providing individuals with \"fair warning\" of what a criminal statute prohibits. Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018); Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 703; 1081 The Senate ultimately accepted the House version of the bill, which excluded an omnibus clause. See United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369, 382-383 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (tracing history of the proposed omnibus provision in the witness-protection legislation). During the floor debate on the bill, Senator Heinz, one of the initiators and primary backers of the legislation, explained that the omnibus clause was beyond the scope of the witness-protection measure at issue and likely \"duplicative\" of other obstruction laws, 128 Cong. Rec. 26,810 (1982) (Sen. Heinz), presumably referring to Sections 1503 and 1505. 1082 In a separate section addressing considerations unique to the presidency, we consider principles of statutory construction relevant in that context.

There are reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a \"thing of value\" within the meaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did not obtain admissible evidence likely to meet the government\u0027s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these individuals acted \"willfully,\" i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and, second, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(l)(A)(i). i. Thing-of Value Element A threshold legal question is whether providing to a campaign \"documents and information\" of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution. The foreign contribution ban is not limited to contributions of money. It expressly prohibits \"a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012l(a)(l)(A), (a)(2) (emphasis added). And the term \"contribution\" is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws to \"include[]\" \"any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added). The phrases \"thing of value\" and \"anything of value\" are broad and inclusive enough to encompass at least some forms of valuable information. Throughout the United States Code, these phrases serve as \"term[ s] of art\" that are construed \"broad[ly].\" United States v. Nilsen, 967 F .2d 539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (\"thing of value\" includes \"both tangibles and intangibles\"); see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 20l(b)(l), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id. \u00a7 641 (theft of government property).

The President Directs Trump Jr.\u0027s Response to Press Inquiries About the June 9 Meeting The following week, the President departed on an overseas trip for the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, accompanied by Hicks, Raffel, Kushner, and Tvanka Trump, among others.694 On July 7, 2017, while the President was overseas, Hicks and Raffel learned that the New York Times was working on a story about the June 9 meeting.695 The next day, Hicks told the President about the story and he directed her not to comment.696 Hicks thought the President\u0027s reaction was odd because he usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.697 Later that day, Hicks and the President again spoke about the story.698 Hicks recalled that the President asked 685 Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 8; Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 2. 686 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 2; Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 9. 687 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 2-3. 688 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 2-3; Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 9. 689 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 3; Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 9. 690 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 3. 691 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 3. 692 Hicks 12/7/ 17 3 02, at 9. 693 Raffel 2/8/18 302, at 5. 694 Raffel 2/8/18 302, at 6. 695 Raffel 2/8/ 18 3 02, at 6-7; Hicks 3/ 13/ l 8 3 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 11}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_62", "label": "par_62", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e Harm to Ongoing Matter Harm to Ongoing Matter In May 2016, IRA employees, claiming to be U.S. social activists and administrators ofFacebook groups, recruited U.S. persons to hold signs (including one in front of the White House) that read \"Happy 55th Birthda Dear Boss,\" as an homa e to Pri ozhin whose 55th birthda was on June 1, 2016 .31 Harr,, ,v \u0027-\u0027\u0027 ll::jVI I \u0027l::I 1v1a,u:;r Harm to Ongoing Matter C.

Over the ensuing weeks, the GRU traversed the network, identifying different computers connected to the DCCC network. By stealing network access credentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the system), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network.119 Approximately six days after first hacking into the DCCC network, on April 18, 2016, GRU officers gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection120 between the DCCC and DNC networks.121 Between April 18, 2016 and June 8, 2016, Unit 26165 compromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mail server and shared file server.122 b. Implantation of Ma/ware on DCCC and DNC Networks Unit 26165 implanted on the DCCC and DNC networks two types of customized malware, 123 known as \"X-Agent\" and \"X-Tunnel\"; Mimikatz, a credential-harvesting tool; and rar.exe, a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration. X-Agent was a multi-function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes, take screenshots, and gather other data about the infected computers (e.g., file directories, operating systems).124 Tunnel was a hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC computers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networks that was capable of large-scale data transfers.125 GRU officers then used X-Tunnel to exfiltrate stolen data from the victim computers. 120 A VPN extends a private network, allowing users to send and receive data across public networks (such as the internet) as if the connecting computer was directly connected to the private network. The VPN in this case had been created to give a small number of DCCC employees access to certain databases housed on the DNC network. Therefore, while the DCCC employees were outside the DNC\u0027s private network, they could access parts of the DNC network from their DCCC computers.

These authorities would support the view that candidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision offunds, but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value. At the same time, no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to a contribution under campaign-finance law. Such an interpretation could have implications beyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign contributions), and raise First Amendment questions. Those questions could be especially difficult where the information consisted simply of the recounting of historically accurate facts. It is uncertain how courts would resolve those issues. ii. Willfulness Even assuming that the promised \"documents and information that would incriminate Hillary\" constitute a \"thing of value\" under campaign-finance law, the government would encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Most significantly, the government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant acted \"knowingly and willfully,\" the government would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec. 2017) (\"Election Offenses\"); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation requires \"proof of the defendant\u0027s knowledge of the law\"); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577 (\"knowledge of general unlawfulness\"). \"This standard creates an elevated scienter element requiring, at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear. When there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the offender is more likely to have an intent defense.\" Election Offenses 123. \u00b7 On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_632", "label": "par_632", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atterfte,, Werle Prnattet // Mtty Cefttttift Mttterittl Preteetea Uttaer Fea.

R. C!\u0027im. P. 6(e) Analysis In analyzing the President\u0027s conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, litlllll, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. The President\u0027s actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to prevent particular witnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing, delaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement. With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging him to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him before he began to cooperate with the government. When Flynn\u0027s attorneys withdrew him from a joint defense agreement with the President, signaling that Flynn \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_695", "label": "par_695", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e could no longer share information under a joint defense agreement, the President\u0027s personal counsel stated that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn\u0027s hostility towards the President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn\u0027s decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn\u0027s counsel. With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President\u0027s actions had the potential to influence Manafort\u0027s decision whether to cooperate with the government. The President and his personal counsel made repeated statements suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Mana fort, while also making it clear that the President did not want Manafort to \"flip\" and cooperate with the government. On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort\u0027s D.C. case was considering whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he \"felt badly\" for Manafort and stated, \"I think a lot of it is very unfair.\" And when asked about a pardon for Manafort, the President said, \"I do want to see people treated fairly. That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about.\" Later that day, after Manafort\u0027s bail was revoked, t.he President called it a \"tough sentence\" that was \"Very unfair!\" Two days later, the President\u0027s personal counsel stated that individuals involved in the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation could receive a pardon \"if in fact the [P]resident and his advisors ... come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly\"-using language that paralleled how the President had already described the treatment ofManafort. Those statements, combined with the President\u0027s commendation ofManafort for being a \"brave man\" who \"refused to \u0027break\u0027,\" suggested that a pardon was a more likely possibility if Mana fort continued not to cooperate with the government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to investigators. The President\u0027s public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury deliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second day of trial, for example, the President called the prosecution a \"terrible situation\" and a \"hoax\" that \"continues to stain our country\" and referred to Manafort as a \"Reagan/Dole darling\" who was \"serving solitary confinement\" even though h\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "Red", "id": "May Cm~taitt", "label": "May Cm~taitt", "shape": "dot", "title": "May Cm~taitt", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "John Podesta\u0027s", "label": "John Podesta\u0027s", "shape": "dot", "title": "John Podesta\u0027s", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Prince", "label": "Prince", "shape": "dot", "title": "Prince", "value": 9}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Kushner", "label": "Kushner", "shape": "dot", "title": "Kushner", "value": 48}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Bannon", "label": "Bannon", "shape": "dot", "title": "Bannon", "value": 36}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_227", "label": "par_227", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e 14 event.604 Simes and Kushner spoke again on a March 24, 2016 telephone call,605 three days after Trump had publicly named the team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short notice.606 On March 31, 2016, Simes and Kushner had an in-person, one-on-one meeting in Kushner\u0027s New York office.607 During that meeting, Simes told Kushner that the best way to handle foreign-policy issues for the \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_237", "label": "par_237", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e , at 29-30; Simes 3/27/18 302, at 6; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 12. 659 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 30; Simes 3/27 /l 8 302, at 6. 660 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 30. 661 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 30; Simes 3/27/18 302, at 6. 662 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 12. 109 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_550", "label": "par_550", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e /31/17 302, at 7. 410 S.

Even if the removal of the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a new appointee, a factfinder would need to consider whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the investigation, chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the investigation. A threshold question is whetherthe President in fact directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. After news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly disputed these accounts, and privately told McGahn that he had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the Department of Justice\u0027s attention. See Volume II, Section II.I, infra. Some of the President\u0027s specific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation. Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed. First, McGahn\u0027s clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein not only that conflicts existed but also that \"Mueller has to go.\" McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.601 McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President\u0027s request. In response to that request, McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin to the Saturday Night Massacre. He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President had asked him to \"do crazy shit,\" and informed Priebus and Bannon \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_605", "label": "par_605", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e \"knocking out Mueller\" and raised conflicts of interest in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan to remove the Special Counsel.

In addition to those general factors, we took into account more specific factors in assessing the credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts. For example, contemporaneous written notes can provide strong corroborating evidence. See United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 232 (1975) (the fact that a \"statement appeared in the contemporaneously recorded report ... would tend strongly to corroborate the investigator\u0027s version of the interview\"). Similarly, a witness\u0027s recitation of his account before he had any motive to fabricate also supports the witness\u0027s credibility. See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 158 (l 995) (\"A consistent statement that predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived as a consequence of that motive.\"). Finally, a witness\u0027s false description of an encounter can imply consciousness of wrongdoing. See Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (noting the \"well-settled principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence-often strong evidence-of guilt\").

DOJ Officials Notify the White House of Their Conc_erns About Flynn On January 26, 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House Counsel Donald McGahn and informed him that she needed to discuss a sensitive matter with him in person.142 Later that day, Yates and Mary McCord, a senior national security official at the Department of Justice, met at the White House with McGahn and White House Counsel\u0027s Office attorney James Burnham.143 Yates said that the public statements made by the Vice President denying that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions were not true and put Flynn in a potentially compromised position because the Russians would know he had lied.144 Yates disclosed that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI.145 She declined to answer a specific question about how Flynn had performed during that interview, 146 but she indicated that Flynn\u0027s statements to the FBI were similar to the statements he had made to Pence and Spicer denying that he had discussed sanctions.147 McGahn came away from the meeting with the impression that the FBI had not pinned Flynn down in lies, 148 but he asked John Eisenberg, who served as legal advisor to the National Security Council, to examine potential legal issues raised by Flynn\u0027s FBI interview and his contacts with Kislyak.149 That afternoon, McGahn notified the President that Yates had come to the White House to discuss concerns about Flynn.150 McGahn described what Yates had told him, and the President asked him to repeat it, so he did.151 McGahn recalled that when he described the FBI interview of Flynn, he said that Flynn did not disclose having discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but that there may not have been a clear violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 I 001.152 The President asked about Section 1001, and McGahn explained the law to him, and also explained the Logan Act. 153 The President 142 Yates 8/ 15/17 302, at 6. 143 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 6; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 6; SCR0l5 000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). 144 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 6-8; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 6-7; Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 4; SCRO l 5_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). 145 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 5; Yates 8/15/17 302, at 7; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 7; Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 4. 146 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 7; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 7. 147 SCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 4. 148 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 5. 149 SCR0l5_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President); McGahn 1 1 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 11}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_482", "label": "par_482", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Proeit:iet // May CoHtaiH Material Pwteeteti UHtier Feti.

FEC, 800 F. Supp. 2d 281, 288 (D.D.C. 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., for three-judge court), ajf\u0027d, 565 U.S. 1104 (2012). To that end, federal finance law broadly prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions, donations, expenditures, or other disbursements in connection with federal, state, or local candidate elections, and prohibits anyone from soliciting, accepting, or receiving such contributions or donations. As relevant here, foreign nationals may not make-and no one may \"solicit,\u0027 accept, or receive\" from them-\"a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value\" or \"an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(a)(l)(A), (a)(2).1283 The term \"contribution,\" which is used throughout the campaign-finance law, \"includes\" \"any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, \"the value of [volunteer] services.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(B)(i). Foreign nationals are also barred from making \"an expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement for an electioneering communication.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(a)(l)(C). The term \"expenditure\" \"includes\" \"any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7,30101(9)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, news stories and non-partisan get-out-the-vote activities. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 3010 I (9)(B)(i)-(ii). An \"independent expenditure\" is an expenditure \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate\" and made independently of the campaign. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(17). An \"electioneering communication\" is a broadcast communication that \"refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\" and is made within specified time periods and targeted at the relevant electorate. 52 u.s.c. \u00a7 30104(f)(3). The statute defines \"foreign national\" by reference to FARA and the Immigration and Nationality Act, with minor modification. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(b) (cross-referencing 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 61 l(b)(l)-(3) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20), (22)). That definition yields five, overlapping categories of foreign nationals, which include all of the individuals and entities relevant for present purposes-namely, foreign governments and political parties, individuals 1283 Campaign-finance law also places financial limits on contributions, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30116(a), and prohibits contributions from corporations, banks, and labor unions, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 3011 S(a); see Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 320 (2010). Because the conduct that the Office investigated involved possible electoral activity by foreign nationals, the foreign-contributions ban is the most readily applicable provision. 184 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_377", "label": "par_377", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e v.

R. Crim.. P. 6(e) I. BACKGROUND LEGAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRINCIPLES A. Legal Framework of Obstruction of Justice The May 17, 2017 Appointment Order and the Special Counsel regulations provide this Office with jurisdiction to investigate \"federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a). Because of that description of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice investigation with the elements of obstruction offenses in mind. Our evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the elements of such offenses, although we do not draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that govern a prosecutorial decision under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.000 et seq. (2018). Here, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant obstruction statutes in an ordinary case. This discussion does not address the unique constitutional issues that arise in an inquiry into official acts by the President. Those issues are discussed in a later section of this report addressing constitutional defenses that the President\u0027s counsel have raised. See Volume II, Section III.B, irifra. Three basic elements are common to most of the relevant obstruction statutes: ( 1) an obstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt intent. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1505, 1512(c)(2). We describe those elements as they have\u0027 been interpreted by the courts. We then discuss a more specific statute aimed at witness tampering, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b), and describe the requirements for attempted offenses and endeavors to obstruct justice, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 I 503, 1512(c)(2). Obstructive act. Obstruction-of-justice law \"reaches all corrupt conduct capable of producing an effect that prevents justice from being duly administered, regardless of the means employed.\" United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (11th Cir. 1984) (interpreting 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1503). An \"effort to influence\" a proceeding can qualify as an endeavor to obstruct justice even if the effort was \"subtle or circuitous\" and \"however cleverly or with whatever cloaking of purpose\" it was made. United States v. Roe, 529 F.2d 629,632 (4th Cir. 1975); see also United States v. Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir. 2006). The verbs \u0027\"obstruct or impede\u0027 are broad\" and \"can refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult, or hinders.\" Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). An improper motive can render an actor\u0027s conduct criminal even when the conduct would otherwise be lawful and within the actor\u0027s authority. See United States v. Cueto, 151 F.3d 620, 631 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming obstruction conviction of a criminal defense attorney for related conduct\"); United States v. Cintolo, 818 F .2d 980, 992 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"any act by any party-whether lawful or unlawful on its face-may abridge \u00a7 1503 if performed with a corrupt motive\"). Nexus to a pending or contemplated official proceeding. Obstruction-of-justice law generally requires a nexus, or connection, to an official proceeding. In Section 1503, the nexus must be to pending \"judicial or grand jury proceedings.\" United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 9 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 9}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_429", "label": "par_429", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AttorHe\".Y\u0027 Werle Proattet // May CoHtaiH Material Proteetea UHaer Fee. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) 599 (1995). In Section 1505, the nexus can include a connection to a \"pending\" federal agency proceeding or a congressional inquiry or investigation. Under both statutes, the government must demonstrate \"a relationship in time, causation, or logic\" between the obstructive act and the proceeding or inquiry to be obstructed. Id. at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 707-708 (2005). Section I 5 I 2(c) prohibits obstructive efforts aimed at official proceedings including judicial or grand jury proceedings. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 l 5(a)(l )(A). \"For purposes of\u0027 Section 1512, \"an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 l 2(f)(l ). Although a proceeding need not already be in progress to trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to a contemplated proceeding still must be shown. United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368,386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438,445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). The nexus requirement narrows the scope of obstruction statutes to ensure that individuals have \"fair warning\" of what the law proscribes. Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600 (internal quotation marks omitted). The nexus showing has subjective and objective components. As an objective matter, a defendant must act \"in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,\" such that the statute \"excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful.\" Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 ( emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he endeavor must have the natural \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_430", "label": "par_430", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice.\" Id. at 599 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As a subjective matter, the actor must have \"contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.\" Petruk, 781 F .3d at 445-446 .. A defendant need not directly impede the proceeding. Rather, a nexus exists if \"discretionary actions of a third person would be required to obstruct the judicial proceeding if it was foreseeable to the defendant that the third party would act on the [defendant\u0027s] communication in such a way as to obstruct the judicial proceeding.\" United States v. Martinez, 862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 2017) (brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted). Corruptly. The word \"corruptly\" provides the intent element for obstruction of justice and means acting \"knowingly and dishonestly\" or \"with an improper motive.\" United States v. Richardson, 676 F.3d 491, 508 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 (I 0th Cir. 2013) (to act corruptly means to \"act[] with an improper purpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, impede or obstruct\" the relevant proceeding) (some quotation marks omitted); see 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1515(6) (\"As used in section 1505, the term \u0027corruptly\u0027 means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another.\"); see also Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (interpreting \"corruptly\" to mean \"wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil\" and holding that acting \"knowingly ... corruptly\" in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(6) requires \"consciousness of wrongdoing\"). The requisite showing is made when a person acted with an intent to obtain an \"improper advantage for [him]self or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.\" BALLENTINE\u0027S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F .3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (characterizing this definition as the \"longstanding and well-accepted meaning\" of \"corruptly\"). Witness tampering. A more specific provision in Section 1512 prohibits tampering with a witness. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(6 )(I), (3) (making it a crime to \"knowingly use[] intimidation ... or corruptly persuade[] another person,\" or \"engage[] in misleading conduct towards another 10 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_431", "label": "par_431", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AfteFHe~\u00b7 Werk Pretlttet // May CetttaiH Material Preteetetl UHtlet\u0027 Fee. R. Crim.. P. 6(e) person,\" with the intent to \"influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding\" or to \"hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer ... of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense\"). To establish corrupt persuasion, it is sufficient that the defendant asked a potential witness to lie to investigators in contemplation of a likely federal investigation into his conduct. United States v. Ed/ind, 887 F.3d 166, 174 (4th Cir. 2018); United States v. Sparks, 791 F.3d 1188, 1191-1192 (10th Cir. 2015); United States v. Byrne, 435 F.3d 16, 23-26 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. LaShay, 417 F .3d 715, 718-719 (7th Cir. 2005); United States v. Burns, 298 F .3d 523, 539-540 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Pennington, 168 F.3d 1060, 1066 (8th Cir. 1999). The \"persuasion\" need not be coercive, intimidating, or explicit; it is sufficient to \"urge,\" \"induce,\" \"ask[],\" \"argu[ e ],\" \"giv[ e] reasons,\" Sparks, 791 F .3d at 1192, or \"coach[] or remind[] witnesses by planting misleading facts,\" Ed/ind, 887 F.3d at 174. Corrupt persuasion is shown \"where a defendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the story were true, intending that the witness believe the story and testify to it.\" United States v. Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. 1986); see United States v. Gabriel, 125 F .3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 1997). It also covers urging a witness to recall a fact that the witness did not know, even if the fact was actually true. See LaShay, 417 F .3d at 719. Corrupt persuasion also \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_432", "label": "par_432", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e can be shown in certain circumstances when a person, with an improper motive, urges a witness not to cooperate with law enforcement. See United States v. Shotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cr. 1998) (telling Secretary \"not to [say] anything [to the FBI] and [she] would not be bothered\"). When the charge is acting with the intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the communication of information to law enforcement under Section l 512(b)(3), the \"nexus\" to a proceeding inquiry articulated in Aguilar-that an individual have \"knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding,\" 515 U.S. at 599-does not apply because the obstructive act is aimed at the communication of information to investigators, not at impeding an official proceeding. Acting \"knowingly ... corruptly\" requires proof that the individual was \"conscious of wrongdoing.\" Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (declining to explore \"[t]he outer limits of this element\" but indicating that an instruction was infirm where it permitted conviction even if the defendant \"honestly and sincerely believed that [the] conduct was lawful\"). It is an affirmative defense that \"the conduct consisted solely oflawful conduct.and that the defendant\u0027s sole intention was to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(e). Attempts and endeavors. Section I 512( c )(2) covers both substantive obstruction offenses and attempts to obstruct justice. Under general principles of attempt law, a person is guilty of an attempt when he has the intent to commit a substantive offense and takes an overt act that constitutes a substantial step towards that goal. See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102, 106-107 (2007). \"[T]he act [must be] substantial, in that it was strongly corroborative of the defendant\u0027s criminal purpose.\" United States v. Pratt, 351 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 2003). While \"mere abstract talk\" does not suffice, any \"concrete and specific\" acts that corroborate the defendant\u0027s intent can constitute a \"substantial step.\" United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d 1184, 1198-1205 (10th Cir. 2011).

Accordingly, determinations on intent are frequently reached without the opportunity to interview an investigatory subject. Obstruction-of-justice cases are consistent with this rule. See, e.g., Ed/ind, 887 F.3d at 174, 176 (relying on \"significant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] was conscious of her wrongdoing\" in an obstruction case; \"[b]ecause evidence of intent will almost always be circumstantial, a defendant may be found culpable where the reasonable and foreseeable consequences of her acts are the obstruction of justice\") (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and punctuation omitted); Quattrone, 441 F.3d at 173-174. Circumstantial evidence that illuminates intent may include a pattern of potentially obstructive acts. Fed. R. Evid. 404(6) (\"Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act ... may be admissible ... [to] prov[ e] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\"); see, e.g., United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F .3d 641, 648-650 ( I st Cir. 1996); United States v. Arnold, 773 F .2d 823, 832-834 (7th Cir. 1985); Cintolo, 818 F .2d at 1000. Credibility judgments may also be made based on objective facts and circumstantial evidence. Standard jury instructions highlight a variety of factors that are often relevant in 13 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_763", "label": "par_763", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e l 2{c){2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive Acts Several textual features of Section 1512( c )(2) support the conclusion that the provision broadly prohibits corrupt means of obstructing justice and is not limited by the more specific prohibitions in Section 1512( c )(I), which focus on evidence impairment. First, the text of Section 1512( c )(2) is unqualified: it reaches acts that \"obstruct[], influence[], or impede[] any official proceeding\" when committed \"corruptly.\" Nothing in Section 1512(c)(2)\u0027s text limits the provision to acts that would impair the integrity or availability of evidence for use in an official proceeding. In contrast, Section 1512(c)(I) explicitly includes the requirement that the defendant act \"with the intent to impair the object\u0027s integrity or availability 1077 See U.S. Br., United States v. Kumar, Nos. 06-5482-cr(L), 06-5654-cr(CON) (2d Cir. filed Oct. 26, 2007), at pp. 15-28; United States v. Singleton, Nos. H-04-CR-514SS, H-06-cr-80 (S.D.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) for use in an official proceeding,\" a requirement that Congress also included in two other sections of Section 1512. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with intent to cause a person to destroy an object \"with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding\"); 1512(6 )(2)(B) (use of intimidation, threats, corrupt persuasion, or misleading conduct with intent to cause a person to destroy an object \"with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding\"). But no comparable intent or conduct element focused on evidence impairment appears in Section 1512( c )(2). The intent element in Section l 512(c)(2) comes from the word \"corruptly.\" See, e.g., United.States v. McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"The intent element is important because the word \u0027corruptly\u0027 is what serves to separate criminal and innocent acts of obstruction.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). And the conduct element in Section 1512( c )(2) is \"obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing]\" a proceeding. Congress is presumed to have acted intentionally in the disparate inclusion and exclusion of evidence-impairment language. See Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351,358 (2014) (\"[W]hen \u0027Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but om its it in another\u0027 -let alone in the very next provision-th is Court \u0027presume[ s]\u0027 that Congress intended a difference in meaning\") (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)); accord Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. 767, 777(2018). Second, the structure of Section 1512 supports the conclusion that Section 1512( c )(2) defines an independent offense. Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete crime with different elements from Section I 5 I 2(c)(I )-and each subsection of Section 1512(c) contains its own \"attempt\" prohibition, underscoring that they are independent prohibitions. The two subsections of Section 1512(c) are connected by the conjunction \"or,\" indicating that each provides an alternative basis for criminal liability. See Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357 (\"ordinary use [of \u0027or\u0027] is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings\") (internal quotation marks omitted). In Loughrin, for example, the Supreme Court relied on the use of the word \"or\" to hold that adjacent and overlapping subsections of the bank fraud statute, 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1344, state distinct offenses and that subsection 1344(2) therefore should not be interpreted to contain an additional element specified only in subsection 1344(1 ).

Ct. 462, 465-469 (2016) (recognizing that the subsections of the bank fraud statute \"overlap substantially\" but identifying distinct circumstances covered by each).1078 And here, as in Loughrin, Section 1512(c)\u0027s \"two clauses have separate numbers, line breaks before, between, and after them, and equivalent indentation-thus placing the clauses visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings.\" 573 U.S. at 359. Third, the introductory word \"otherwise\" in Section 1512( c )(2) signals that the provision covers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512( c )(I). See Black\u0027s Law Dictionary 1101 (6th ed. 1990) (\"otherwise\" means \"in a different manner; in another way, or in other ways\"); see also, e.g., American Heritage College Dictionary Online (\"I. In another way; 1078 The Office of Legal Counsel recently relied on several of the same interpretive principles in concluding that language that appeared in the first clause of the Wire Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 I 084, restricting its prohibition against certain betting or wagering activities to \"any sporting event or contest,\" did not apply to the second clause of the same statute, which reaches other betting or wagering activities. See Reconsidering Whether the Wire Act Applies to Non-Sports Gambling (Nov. 2, 2018), slip op. 7 (relying on plain language); id. at 11 (finding it not \"tenable to read into the second clause the qualifier \u0027on any sporting event or contest\u0027 that appears in the first clause\"); id. at 12 (relying on Digital Realty). 161 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 9}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_765", "label": "par_765", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department ofJustice Atlertte:) \\\\\u0027erk Pretlttet // May CetttttiH Material Preteetetl Utttler Fee.

United States, 368 F.3d 190,200 (2d Cir. 2004) (construing \"otherwise\" in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2466(l)(C) to reach beyond the \"specific examples\" listed in prior subsections, thereby covering the \"myriad means that human ingenuity might devise to permit a person to avoid the jurisdiction of a court\"); cf Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 144 (2006) (recognizing that \"otherwise\" is defined to mean \"in a different way or manner,\" and holding that the word \"otherwise\" introducing the residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), can, but need not necessarily, \"refer to a crime that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others\"). 1079 The purpose of the word \"otherwise\" in Section 1512( c )(2) is therefore to clarify that the provision covers obstructive acts other than the destruction of physical evidence with the intent to impair its integrity or availability, which is the conduct addressed in Section l 5 l \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_766", "label": "par_766", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e 2(c)( I). The word \"otherwise\" does not signal that Section 1512( c )(2) has less breadth in covering obstructive conduct than the language of the provision implies. 2. Judicial Decisions Support a Broad Reading of Section 1512(c)(2) Courts have not limited Section 1512( c )(2) to conduct that impairs evidence, but instead have read it to cover obstructive acts in any form. As one court explained, \"[t]his expansive subsection operates as a catch-all to cover \u0027otherwise\u0027 obstructive behavior that might not constitute a more specific offense like document destruction, which is listed in (c)(l).\" United States v. Volpendesto, 746 F.3d 273, 286 (7th Cir. 2014) (some quotation marks omitted). For example, in United States v. Ring, 628 F. Supp. 2d 195 (D.D.C. 2009), the court rejected the argument that\"\u00a7 1512( c )(2)\u0027s reference to conduct that \u0027otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding\u0027 is limited to conduct that is similar to the type of conduct proscribed by subsection (c)(l)-namely, conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of \u0027record[s], documents[s], or other object[s] for use in an official proceeding.\" Id. at 224. The court explained that \"the meaning of\u00a7 1512(c)(2) is plain on its face.\" Id. (alternations in original). And courts have upheld convictions under Section l 512(c)(2) that did not involve evidence impairment, but instead resulted from conduct that more broadly thwarted arrests or investigations. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, 862 F.3d 223,238 (2d Cir. 2017) (police officer tipped off suspects about issuance of arrest warrants before \"outstanding warrants could be executed, thereby potentially interfering with an ongoing grand jury proceeding\"); United States v. Ahrensfield, 698 F.3d 1310, 1324-1326 (10th Cir. 2012) (officer disclosed existence of an undercover investigation to its target); United States v. Phillips, 583 F .3d 1261, 1265 (10th Cir. 2009) ( defendant disclosed identity of an undercover officer thus preventing him from making controlled purchases from methamphetamine dealers). Those cases illustrate, that Section 1512(c)(2) applies to corrupt acts-including by public officials-that frustrate the 1079 In Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 15 (2011 ), the Supreme Court substantially abandoned Begay\u0027s reading of the residual clause, and in Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Court invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. Begay\u0027s analysis of the word \"otherwise\" is thus of limited value. 162 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_768", "label": "par_768", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice At:tertte~\u00b7 \u0027.l/erk Pretittet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteeteti Utttier Fee.

Ct. at 469.1080 3. The Legislative History of Section l512(c)(2) Does Not Justify Narrowing Its Text \"Given the straightforward statutory command\" in Section l512(c)(2), \"there is no reason to resort to legislative history.\" United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 6 (1997). In any event, the legislative history of Section 1512(c)(2) is not a reason to impose extratextual limitations on its reach. Congress enacted Section 1512( c )(2) as part the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, Tit. XI, \u00a7 1102, 116 Stat. 807. The relevant section of the statute was entitled \"Tampering with a Record or Otherwise Impeding an Official Proceeding.\" 116 Stat. 807 ( emphasis added). That title indicates that Congress intended the two clauses to have independent effect. Section 1512( c) was added as a floor amendment in the Senate and explained as closing a certain \"loophole\" with respect to \"document shredding.\" See 148 Cong. Rec. S6545 (July I 0, 2002) (Sen. Lott); id. at S6549-S6550 (Sen: Hatch). But those explanations do not limit the enacted text. See Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U.S. 105, 115 (1988) (\"[l]t is not the law that a statute can have no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history.\"); see also Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 138 S. Ct. 1134, 1143 (2018) (\"Even if Congress did not foresee all of the applications of the statute, that is no reason not to give the statutory text a fair reading.\"). The floor statements thus cannot detract from the meaning of the enacted text. See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 457 (2002) (\"Floor statements from two Senators .cannot amend the clear and unambiguous language of a statute. We see no reason to give greater weight to the views of two Senators than to the collective votes of both Houses, which are memorialized in the unambiguous statutory text.\"). That principle has particular force where one of the proponents of the amendment to Section 1512 introduced his remarks as only \"briefly elaborat[ing] on some of the specific provisions contained in this bill.\" 148 Cong. Rec. S6550 (Sen. Hatch). Indeed, the language Congress used in Section 1512( c )(2)-prohibiting \"corruptly ... obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing] any official proceeding\" or attempting to do parallels a provision that Congress considered years earlier in a bill designed to strengthen protections against witness tampering and obstruction of justice. While the earlier provision is not a direct antecedent of Section 1512(c)(2), Congress\u0027s understanding of the broad scope of the 1080 The Supreme Court\u0027s decision in Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101 (2018), does not support imposing a non-textual limitation on Section I 512(c)(2). Marinello interpreted the tax \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 14}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_772", "label": "par_772", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attet\u0027fley Werk Pre,duet // Mft; Ce,HtftiH Materiftl Preteetee UHeer Fed. R. Crilfl. P. 6(e) c. Finally, the rule of lenity does not justify treating Section 1512( c )(2) as a prohibition on evidence impairment, as opposed to an omnibus clause. The rule of lenity is an interpretive principle that resolves ambiguity in criminal laws in favor of the less-severe construction. Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000). \"[ A \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 3}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_773", "label": "par_773", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e ]s [the Court has] repeatedly emphasized,\" however, the rule of lenity applies only if, \"after considering text, structure, history and purpose, there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.\" Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 188 n.10 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). The rule has been cited, for example, in adopting a narrow meaning of\"tangible object\" in an obstruction statute when the prohibition\u0027s title, history, and list of prohibited acts indicated a focus on destruction of records. See Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074, 1088 (2015) (plurality opinion) (interpreting \"tangible object\" in the phrase \"record, document, or tangible object\" in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519 to mean an item capable of recording or preserving information).\u00b7 Here, as discussed above, the text, structure, and history of Section l 5 I 2(c)(2) leaves no \"grievous ambiguity\" about the statute\u0027s meaning. Section l 512(c)(2) defines a structurally independent general prohibition on obstruction of official proceedings. 5. Other Obstruction Statutes Might Apply to the Conduct in this Investigation Regardless whether Section 1512( c )(2) covers all corrupt acts that obstruct, influence, or impede pending or contemplated proceedings, other statutes would apply to such conduct in pending proceedings, provided that the remaining statutory elements are satisfied. As discussed above, the omnibus clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a) applies generally to obstruction of pending judicial and grand proceedings.1084 See Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 598 (noting that the clause is \"far more general in scope\" than preceding provisions). Section I 503(a)\u0027s protections extend to witness tampering and to other obstructive conduct that has a nexus to pending proceedings. See Sampson, 898 F.3d at 298-303 \u0026 n.6 (collecting cases from eight circuits holding that Section 1503 covers witness-related obstructive conduct, and cabining prior circuit authority). And Section 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conduct aimed at pending agency and congressional proceedings.1085 See, e.g., United States v. Rainey, 757 F.3d 234, 241-247 (5th Cir. 2014). concluded that the statute did not clearly apply to corrupt conduct by the person himself and the \"core\" conduct to which Section 1505 could constitutionally \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_774", "label": "par_774", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e be applied was one person influencing another person to violate a legal duty. Id. at 379-386. Congress later enacted a provision overturning that result by providing that \"[a]s used in [S]ection 1505, the term \u0027corruptly\u0027 means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another, including by making a false or misleading statement, or withholding, concealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(b). Other courts have declined to follow Poindexter either by limiting it to Section 1505 and the specific conduct at issue in that case, see Brenson, 104 F.3d at 1280-1281; reading it as narrowly limited to ce1tain types of conduct, see United States v. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 629-630 (D.C. Cir. I 996); or by noting that it predated Arthur Andersen\u0027s interpretation of the term \"corruptly,\" see Edwards, 869 F.3d at 501-502. 1084 Section \\ 503(a) provides for criminal punishment of: Whoever ... corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice. 1085 Section 1505 provides for criminal punishment of: 167 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_784", "label": "par_784", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice AtterHe,\u00b7 Werk Pr0attet // May Cel\u0027ltaifl Material Preteetea UHaer Fee. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) a. The Supreme Court\u0027s Separation-of-Powers Balancing Test Applies In This Context A congressionally imposed limitation on presidential action is assessed to determine \"the extent to which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions,\" and, if the \"potential for disruption is present[,] ... whether that impact is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.\" Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731,753-754 (1982); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706-707 (l 974). That balancing test applies to a congressional regulation of presidential power through the obstruction-of-justice laws. 1087 When an Article II power has not been \"explicitly assigned by the text of the Constitution to be within the sole province of the President, but rather was thought to be encompassed within the general grant to the President of the \u0027executive Power,\"\u0027 the Court has balanced competing constitutional considerations. Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 484 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and O\u0027Connor, J.). As Justice Kennedy noted in Public Citizen, the Court has applied a balancing test to restrictions on \"the President\u0027s power to remove Executive officers, a power [that] ... is not conferred by any explicit provision in the text of the Constitution (as is the appointment power), \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 6}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_788", "label": "par_788", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e ct. Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2087. For example, although the President\u0027s power to grant pardons is exclusive and not subject to congressional regulation, see United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 147-148 (1872), Congress has the authority to prohibit the corrupt use of\"anything of value\" to influence the testimony of another person in a judicial, congressional, or agency proceeding, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(3)-which would include the offer or promise of a pardon to induce a person to testify falsely or not to testify at all. The offer of a pardon would precede the act of pardoning and thus be within Congress\u0027s power to regulate even if the pardon itself is not. Just as the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 6, cl. I, absolutely protects legislative acts, but not a legislator\u0027s \"taking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in a certain way ... for it is taking the bribe, not performance of the illicit compact, that is a criminal act,\" United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 526 (1972) ( emphasis omitted), the promise of a pardon to corruptly influence testimony would not be a constitutionally immunized act. The application of obstruction statutes to such promises therefore would raise no serious of-powers issue. b. The Effect of Obstruction-of-Justice Statutes on the President\u0027s Capacity to Perform His Article II Responsibilities is Limited Under the Supreme Court\u0027s balancing test for analyzing separation-of-powers issues, the first task i\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_791", "label": "par_791", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atteffley Werk Product// Ma, Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) only when it is taken with the \"corrupt\" intent to obstruct justice. The obstruction statutes thus would restrict presidential action only by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official proceedings for the improper purpose of protecting his own interests. See Volume IT, Section TII.A.3, supra. The direct effect on the President\u0027s freedom of action would correspondingly be a limited one. A preclusion of \"corrupt\" official action is not a major intrusion on Article II powers. For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act with the intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such personal purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. And the Constitution does not mandate that the President have unfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever, in order to carry out his Article II functions. See Heckler v. Chaney, 4 70 U.S. 821, 833 ( 1985) (\"Congress may limit an agency\u0027s exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive priorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency\u0027s power to discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue.\"); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707 (\"[t]o read the Art. II powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege [to withhold confidential communications from a criminal trial] ... would upset the constitutional balance of \u0027a workable government\u0027 and gravely impair the role of the courts under Art. III\"). Nor must the President have unfettered authority to remove all Executive Branch officials involved in the execution of the laws. The Constitution establishes that Congress has legislative authority to structure the Executive Branch by authorizing Congress to create executive departments and officer positions and to specify how inferior officers are appointed. E.g., U.S. CONST., ART. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); ART. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1 (Opinions Clause); ART. TI, \u00a7 2, cl. 2 (Appointments Clause); see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 499. While the President\u0027s removal power is an important means of ensuring that officers faithfully execute the law, Congress has a recognized authority to place certain limits on removal. Id. at 493-495. The President\u0027s removal powers are at their zenith with respect to principal officers-that is, officers who must be appointed by the President and who report to him directly. See Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493, 500. The President\u0027s \"exclusive and illimitable power of removal\" of those principal officers furthers \"the President\u0027s ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed.\" Id. at 493, 498 (internal quotation marks omitted); Myers, 272 U.S. at 627. Thus, \"there are some \u0027purely executive\u0027 officials who must be removable by the President at will if he is able to accomplish his constitutional role.\" Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690; Myers, 272 U.S. at 134 (the President\u0027s \"cabinet officers must do his will,\" and \"[t]he moment that he loses confidence in the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of any one of them, he must have the power to remove him without delay\"); cf Humphrey\u0027s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) (Congress has the power to create independent agencies headed by principal officers removable only for good cause). In light of those constitutional precedents, it may be that the obstruction statutes could not be constitutionally applied to limit the removal of a cabinet officer such as the Attorney General. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 101; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 503. In that context, at least absent circumstances showing that the President was clearly attempting to thwart accountability for personal conduct while evading ordinary political checks and balances, even the highly limited 174 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 7}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_792", "label": "par_792", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Att6mey W6rk Pl\u00276t!1:1et // Ma,\u00b7 C6rttairt Material Pr6teetet!

As Nixon illustrates, the need to safeguard judicial integrity is a compelling constitutional interest. See id. at 709 (noting that the denial of full disclosure of the facts surrounding relevant presidential communications threatens \"[t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system\"). iii. Finally, the grand jury cannot achieve its constitutional purpose absent protection from corrupt acts. Serious federal criminal charges generally reach the Article III courts based on an indictment issued by a grand jury. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 327 (1940) (\"The Constitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process.\"). And the grand jury\u0027s function is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment. U.S. CONST. AMEND. V. (\"[n]o person shall be held to answer\" for a serious crime \"unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury\"). \"[T]he whole theory of [the grand jury\u0027s] function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the Government and the people,\" United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992), \"pledged to indict no one because of prejudice and to free no one because of special favor.\" Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956). If the grand jury were not protected against corrupt interference from all persons, its function as an independent charging body would be thwarted. And an impartial grand jury investigation to determine whether probable cause exists to indict is vital to the criminal justice process. * * * The final step in the constitutional balancing process is to assess whether the of-powers doctrine permits Congress to take action within its constitutional authority notwithstanding the potential impact on Article II functions. See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see also Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696; United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 711-712. In the case of the obstruction-of-justice statutes, our assessment of the weighing of interests leads us to conclude that Congress has the authority to impose the limited restrictions contained in those statutes on the President\u0027s official conduct to protect the integrity of important functions of other branches of government. A general ban on corrupt action does not unduly intrude on the President\u0027s responsibility to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" U.S. CONST.

On the back of a pocket card dated February 5, 2018, Porter took notes that are consistent with his description of the discussion: \"COS: (1) Letter from OM -Never threatened to quit-DJT never told him to fire M.\" SC_RRP000053 (Porter Undated Notes).

R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) meeting that McGahn\u0027s account differed and that McGahn was firm in his views. Shortly after the story broke, the President\u0027s counsel told McGahn \u0027s counsel that the President wanted McGahn to make a statement denying he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded through his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply with the President\u0027s request. The President then directed Sanders to tell McGahn to correct the story, but McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in reporting on the President\u0027s order. Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a correction. More than a week later, the President brought up the issue again with Porter, made comments indicating the President thought McGahn had leaked the story, and directed Porter to have McGahn create a record denying that the President had tried to fire the Special Counsel. At that point, the President said he might \"have to get rid of\u0027 McGahn ifMcGahn did not comply. McGahn again refused and told Porter, as he had told Sanders and as his counsel had told the President\u0027s counsel, that the President had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. That evidence indicates that by the time of the Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not think the story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record denying facts that McGahn believed to be true. The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate. b. Nexus to an official proceeding.

P. 6(e) opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have gathered.\"9 The President declined. 10 Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be inadequate. But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report. As explained in Volume II, Section H.B., we determined that the substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation. * * * 9 12/3/18 Letter, Special Counsel to the President\u0027s Personal Counsel. 1012/12/18 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to the Special Counsel\u0027s Office, at 2.

The President Seeks to Have McGahn Dispute the Press Reports On January 26, 2018, the President\u0027s personal counsel called McGahn \u0027s attorney and said that the President wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to tire the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest.784 McGahn\u0027s attorney spoke with McGahn about that request and then called the President\u0027s personal counsel to relay that McGahn would not make a statement.785 McGahn \u0027s attorney informed the President\u0027s personal counsel that the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed.786 Accordingly, McGahn\u0027s attorney said, although the article was inaccurate in some other respects, McGahn could not comply with the President\u0027s request to dispute the story.787 Hicks recalled relaying to the President that one of his attorneys had spoken to McGahn\u0027s attorney about the issue.788 781 Sophie Tatum \u0026 Kara Scannell, Trump denies he called for Mueller\u0027s firing, CNN (Jan. 26, 2018); Michael S.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) III. LEGAL DEFENSES To THE APPLICATION OF OBSTRUCTION-OF-JUSTICE STATUTES To THE PRESIDENT The President\u0027s personal counsel has written to this Office to advance statutory and constitutional defenses to the potential application of the obstruction-of-justice statutes to the President\u0027s conduct.1072 As a statutory matter, the President\u0027s counsel has argued that a core obstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512( c )(2), does not cover the President\u0027s actions.1073 As a constitutional matter, the President\u0027s counsel argued that the President cannot obstruct justice by exercising his constitutional authority to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate the FBI Director.1074 Under that view, any statute that restricts the President\u0027s exercise of those powers would impermissibly intrude on the President\u0027s constitutional role. The President\u0027s counsel has conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve exercises of his Article JI authority, such as laws prohibiting bribing witnesses or suborning perjury.1075 But counsel has made a categorical argument that \"the President\u0027s exercise of his constitutional authority here to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations cannot constitutionally constitute obstruction of justice.\"1076 In analyzing counsel\u0027s statutory arguments, we concluded that the President\u0027s proposed interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2) is contrary to the litigating position of the Department of Justice and is not supported by principles of statutory construction. As for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts have not definitively resolved these constitutional issues. We therefore analyzed the President\u0027s position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing the separation of powers. Under that framework, we concluded, Article IT of the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize the President from potential liability for the conduct that we investigated. Rather, our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can 1072 6/23/17 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u0027s Office; see also 1/29/18 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u0027s Office; 2/6/18 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u0027s Office; 8/8/18 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u0027s Office, at 4. 1073 2/6/18 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u0027s Office, at 2-9. Counsel has also noted that other potentially applicable obstruction statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, protect only pending proceedings. 6/23/17 Letter, President\u0027s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u0027s Office, at 7-8.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) had not backed down and would not budge.828 Following the Oval Office meeting, the President\u0027s personal counsel called McGahn\u0027 s counsel and relayed that the President was \u0027\"fine\" with McGahn.829 Analysis In analyzing the President\u0027s efforts to have McGahn deny that he had been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. The President\u0027s repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record denying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn from testifying truthfully or to undermine his credibility as a potential witness ifhe testified consistently with his memory, rather than with what the record said. There is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories were published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong and that he had never told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The President correctly understood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he planned to resign. Tn addition, the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and in the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the President said, \"I never said to fire Mueller. I never said \u0027fire.\"\u0027 That evidence could indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade McGahn to change his story but was instead offering his own-but different-recollection of the substance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn\u0027s reaction to them. Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President\u0027s conduct. As previously described, see Volume IT, Section ILE, supra, substantial evidence supports McGahn\u0027s account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed, including the timing and context of the President\u0027s directive; the manner in which McGahn reacted; and the fact that the President had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department of Justice, and should be raised with the President\u0027s personal counsel rather than brought to McGahn. In addition, the President\u0027s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed were carefully worded. When first asked about the New York Times story, the President said, \"Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Times fake story.\" And when the President spoke with McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had used the word \"fire,\" saying, \"I never said to fire Mueller. I never said \u0027fire\"\u0027 and \"Did T say the word \u0027fire\u0027?\" The President\u0027s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the evidence. Tn addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn\u0027s memory of the June 17, 2017 events, the evidence indicates that the President knew by the time of the Oval Office 828 McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 5.

After the story broke, the President, through his personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove the Special Counsel. Each time he was approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute the press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President\u0027s effort to have the Special Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahn in the Oval Office with only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to say that the President never ordered him to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn refused and insisted his memory of the President\u0027s direction to remove the Special Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting, the President challenged McGahn for taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had told Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed. Evidence I. The Press Reports that the President Tried to Fire the Special Counsel On January 25, 2018, the New York Times reported that in June 2017, the President had ordered McGahn to have the Department of Justice fire the Special Counsel.777 According to the article, \"[a]mid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation.\"778 The article further reported that \"[a]fter receiving the president\u0027s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel ... refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead.\"779 The article stated that the president \"ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.\"780 After the article was published, the President 777 Michael S.

McGahn said the President was referring to Donaldson\u0027s notes, which the President thought ofas McGahn\u0027s notes. McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 5. 825 McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 5. 826 McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 5\u003c/a\u003e", "value": 1}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_672", "label": "par_672", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e , the Special Counsel\u0027s Office provided his counsel with a detailed list of topics for a possible interview with the President.830 The President knew that McGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the Special Counsel was investigating and that McGahn had already been interviewed by Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval Office meeting, the President indicated he knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel\u0027s Office about the President\u0027s effort to remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged McGahn for disclosing that information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating unnecessary legal exposure. That evidence indicates the President\u0027s awareness that the June 17, 2017 events were relevant to the Special Counsel\u0027s investigation and any grand jury investigation that might grow out ofit. To establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President\u0027s actions would have the natural tendency to affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or prevent the communication of information to investigators. Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel investigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seeking to influence his prior statements in those interviews. But because McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and the obstruction inquiry was not complete, it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again on obstruction-related topics. If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking to have McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to further investigative interviews would not be shown. But the President\u0027s efforts to have McGahn write a letter \"for our records\" approximately ten days after the stories had come out-well past the typical 830 1/29/ I 8 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Werk Pt\u0027etittet", "label": "Werk Pt\u0027etittet", "shape": "dot", "title": "Werk Pt\u0027etittet", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Mey CeHtttifl", "label": "Mey CeHtttifl", "shape": "dot", "title": "Mey CeHtttifl", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Learns", "label": "Learns", "shape": "dot", "title": "Learns", "value": 2}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Take Over the Investigation", "label": "Take Over the Investigation", "shape": "dot", "title": "Take Over the Investigation", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Again Seeks", "label": "Again Seeks", "shape": "dot", "title": "Again Seeks", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Sessions Reverse his Recusal", "label": "Sessions Reverse his Recusal", "shape": "dot", "title": "Sessions Reverse his Recusal", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Wol\u0027k Pl\u0027oe", "label": "Wol\u0027k Pl\u0027oe", "shape": "dot", "title": "Wol\u0027k Pl\u0027oe", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Pl\u0027oteeteti Utte", "label": "Pl\u0027oteeteti Utte", "shape": "dot", "title": "Pl\u0027oteeteti Utte", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Seeks", "label": "Seeks", "shape": "dot", "title": "Seeks", "value": 2}, {"color": "Red", "id": "\u00b7", "label": "\u00b7", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u00b7", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Cohen Determines", "label": "Cohen Determines", "shape": "dot", "title": "Cohen Determines", "value": 2}, {"color": "Red", "id": "a Broad", "label": "a Broad", "shape": "dot", "title": "a Broad", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_407", "label": "par_407", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Att0rfl:e~\u0141 \\ll0rk Pr0tlttet // Mey C0tttttiH Meterie\u00b7I Pr0teetea UHaer Fee.

R. Crim. P. 6(e) Accordingly, based on the analysis above, we were not persuaded by the argument that the President has blanket constitutional immunity to engage in acts that would corruptly obstruct justice through the exercise of otherwise-valid Article TI powers. 1091 3. Ascertaining Whether the President Violated the Obstruction Statutes Would Not Chill his Performance of his Article II Duties Applying the obstruction statutes to the President\u0027s official conduct would involve determining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the act had a nexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent. But applying those standards to the President\u0027s official conduct should not hinder his ability to perform his Article II duties. Cf Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 752-753 \u0026 n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on the President in adopting a constitutional rule of presidential immunity from private civil damages action based on official duties). Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect: the existence of settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions, and the existence of evidentiary limitations on probing the President\u0027s motives. And historical experience confirms that no impermissible chill should exist. a. As an initial matter, the term \"corruptly\" sets a demanding standard. It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an \"improper advantage for [him]self or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.\" BALLENTINE\u0027S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F .3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir.2015); Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That standard parallels the President\u0027s constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And virtually everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear governmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Accordingly, the President has no reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually all instances, there will be no credible basis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive. That point is illustrated by examples of conduct that would and would not satisfy the stringent corrupt-motive standard. Direct or indirect action by the President to end a criminal investigation into his own or his family members\u0027 conduct to protect against personal embarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly motivated conduct. So too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly and adversely affected the President\u0027s financial interests for the purpose of protecting those interests. In those examples, 1091 A possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not substitute for potential criminal liability after a President leaves office. Impeachment would remove a President from office, but would not address the underlying culpability of the conduct or serve the usual purposes of the criminal law. Indeed, the Impeachment Judgment Clause recognizes that criminal law plays an independent role in addressing an official\u0027s conduct, distinct from the political remedy of impeachment. See U.S. CONST. ART. l, \u00a7 3, cl. 7. Impeachment is also a drastic and rarely invoked remedy, and Congress is not restricted to relying only on impeachment, rather than making criminal law applicable to a former President, as OLC has recognized. A Sitting President\u0027s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op.

R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available. Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. The threshold step under the Justice Manual standards is to assess whether a person\u0027s conduct \"constitutes a federal offense.\" U.S. Dep\u0027t of Justice, Justice Manual\u00a7 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice Manual). Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor\u0027s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.5 The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor\u0027s accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice. OLC noted similar concerns about sealed indictments. Even if an indictment were sealed during the President\u0027s term, OLC reasoned, \"it would be very difficult to preserve [an indictment\u0027s] secrecy,\" and if an indictment became public, \"[t]he stigma and opprobrium\" could imperil the President\u0027s ability to govern.\"6 Although a prosecutor\u0027s internal report would not represent a formal public accusation akin to an indictment, the possibility of the report\u0027s public disclosure and the absence of a neutral adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially determining \"that the person\u0027s conduct constitutes a federal offense.\" Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.220. Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President\u0027s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. * * * \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 2}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Wt\u0027lrlc", "label": "Wt\u0027lrlc", "shape": "dot", "title": "Wt\u0027lrlc", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Ufleer", "label": "Ufleer", "shape": "dot", "title": "Ufleer", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Comey", "label": "Comey", "shape": "dot", "title": "Comey", "value": 2}, {"color": "Blue", "id": "Tn", "label": "Tn", "shape": "dot", "title": "Tn", "value": 6}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Donald McGahn", "label": "Donald McGahn", "shape": "dot", "title": "Donald McGahn", "value": 4}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Werle Preattet", "label": "Werle Preattet", "shape": "dot", "title": "Werle Preattet", "value": 2}, {"color": "Red", "id": "May", "label": "May", "shape": "dot", "title": "May", "value": 1}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_531", "label": "par_531", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attet\u0027Hey Werle Preattet // May CeHtaifl Material Prnteetea UHEler Fee.

STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES The President\u0027s counsel raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible obstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of those legal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts. Statutory defenses. Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice\u0027s general approach to interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is an omnibus obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive acts directed at pending or contemplated official proceedings. No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the provision to cover only conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections 1503 and 1505 also offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, 7 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "1512(c)(2", "label": "1512(c)(2", "shape": "dot", "title": "1512(c)(2", "value": 5}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_424", "label": "par_424", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Attemey Werle Predttet // May CeHtaiH Material Preteeted UH.tier Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) judicial, administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision in Section 1512(6) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or hinder the communication to law enforcement of information related to a federal crime. Constitutional defenses. As for constitutional defenses arising from the President\u0027s status as the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts have not. definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those issues through the framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues. The Department of Justice and the President\u0027s personal counsel have recognized that the President is subject to statutes that prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury because that conduct does not implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the President ca,n be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President\u0027s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice. Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers. The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "1512(6", "label": "1512(6", "shape": "dot", "title": "1512(6", "value": 4}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_762", "label": "par_762", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e , mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object\u0027s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding; or (2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. The Department of Justice has taken the position that Section 1512( c )(2) states a broad, independent, and unqualified prohibition on obstruction of justice.1077 While defendants have argued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to cover only acts that would impair the availability or integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(l)\u0027s focus, strong arguments weigh against that proposed limitation. The text of Section 1512( c )(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to Section 1512( c )(1 ); courts have so interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no principle of statutory construction dictates a contrary view. On its face, therefore, Section 1512( c )(2) applies to all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or including by improper exercises of official power. In addition, other statutory provisions that are potentially applicable to certain conduct we investigated broadly prohibit obstruction of proceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1505. Congress has also specifically prohibited witness tampering. See 18 U .S.C. \u00a7 1512(6 ). I.

R. Criffl. P. 6(e) of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 353-354 (discussing Franklin, Public Citizen, and Sale). The Department of Justice has relied on this clear-statement principle to interpret certain statutes as not applying to the President at all, similar to the approach taken in Franklin. See, e.g., Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising out of the President\u0027s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (criminal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208, does not apply to the President). Other OLC opinions interpret statutory text not to apply to certain presidential or executive actions because of constitutional concerns. See Application of 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 350-357 (consanguinity limitations on court appointments, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458, found inapplicable to \"presidential appointments of judges to the federal judiciary\"); Constraints Imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 on Lobbying Efforts, 13 Op. O.L.C. 300, 304-306 (1989) (limitation on the use of appropriated funds for certain lobbying programs found inapplicable to certain communications by the President and executive officials). But OLC has also recognized that this clear-statement rule \"does not apply with respect to a statute that raises no separation of powers questions were it to be applied to the President,\" such as the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201. Application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. OLC explained that \"[a]pplication of \u00a7 20 I raises no separation of powers question, let alone a serious one,\" because [t]he Constitution confers no power in the President to receive bribes.\" Id. In support of that conclusion, OLC noted constitutional provisions that forbid increases in the President\u0027s compensation while in office, \"which is what a bribe would function to do,\" id. (citing U.S. CONST. ART. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 7), and the express constitutional power of \"Congress to impeach [and convict] a President for, inter alia, bribery,\" id. (citing U.S. CONST. ART II,\u00a7 4). Under OLC\u0027s analysis, Congress can permissibly criminalize ce1tain obstructive conduct by the President, such as suborning perjury, intimidating witnesses, or fabricating evidence, because those prohibitions raise no separation-of-powers questions. See Application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. The Constitution does not authorize the President to engage in such conduct, and those actions would transgress the President\u0027s duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" U.S. CONST. ART IT, \u00a7\u00a7 3. In view of those clearly permissible applications of the obstruction statutes to the President, Franklin\u0027s holding that the President is entirely excluded from a statute absent a clear statement would not apply in this context. A more limited application of a clear-statement rule to exclude from the obstruction statutes only certain acts by the President-for example, removing prosecutors or ending investigations for corrupt reasons-would be difficult to implement as a matter of statutory interpretation. It is not obvious how a clear-statement rule would apply to an omnibus provision like Section 1512( c )(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only when carried out in the President\u0027s conduct of office. No statutory term could easily bear that specialized meaning. For example, the word \"corruptly\" has a well-established meaning that does not exclude exercises of official power for corrupt ends. Indeed, an established definition states that \"corruptly\" means action with an 170 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_795", "label": "par_795", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e forbid removal for a corrupt reason.1088 A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded corrupt action would leave ample room for all other considerations, including disagreement over policy or loss of confidence in the officer\u0027s judgment or commitment. A corrupt-purpose prohibition therefore would not undermine the President\u0027s ability to perform his Article II functions. Accordingly, because the separation-of-powers question is \"whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President\u0027s ability to perform his constitutional duty,\" Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferior officer for a \u0027088 Although the FBT director is an inferior officer, he is appointed by the President and removable by him at will, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 532 note, and it is not clear that Congress could constitutionally provide the FBI director with good-cause tenure protection. See OLC, Constitutionality of Legislation Extending the Term of the FBI Director, 2011 WL 2566125, at *3 (O.L.C. June 20, 2011) (\"tenure protection for an officer with the FBT Director\u0027s broad investigative, administrative, and policymaking responsibilities would raise a serious constitutional question whether Congress had \u0027impede[d] the President\u0027s ability to perform his constitutional duty\u0027 to take care that the laws be faithfully executed\") ( quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691 ). 175 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Nerk PreElttet //", "label": "Nerk PreElttet //", "shape": "dot", "title": "Nerk PreElttet //", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Fowler", "label": "Fowler", "shape": "dot", "title": "Fowler", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Armstrong", "label": "Armstrong", "shape": "dot", "title": "Armstrong", "value": 3}, {"color": "Red", "id": "19 Op", "label": "19 Op", "shape": "dot", "title": "19 Op", "value": 2}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_779", "label": "par_779", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e es should be construed to avoid serious constitutional questions, and Congress should not be assumed to have altered the constitutional separation of powers without clear assurance that it intended that result. OLC, The Constitutional Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. O.L.C. 124, 178 (1996). The Supreme Court has applied that clear-statement rule in several cases. In one leading case, the Court construed the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq., not to apply to judicial review of presidential action. Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-801 (1992). The Court explained that it \"would require an express statement by Congress before assuming it intended the President\u0027s performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\" Id. at 801. In another case, the Court interpreted the word \"utilized\" in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (F ACA), 5 U.S.C. App., to apply only to the use of advisory committees established directly or indirectly by the government, thereby excluding the American Bar Association\u0027s advice to the Department of Justice about federal judicial candidates. Public Citizen v. United States Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 455, 462-467 (1989). The Court explained that a broader interpretation of the term \"utilized\" in F ACA would raise serious questions whether the statute \"infringed unduly on the President\u0027s Article II power to nominate federal judges and violated the doctrine of separation of powers.\" Id. at 466-467. Another case found that an established canon of statutory construction applied with \"special force\" to provisions that would impinge on the President\u0027s foreign-affairs powers if construed broadly. Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, 509 U.S. 155, 188 ( 1993) (applying the presumption against extraterritorial application to construe the Refugee Act of 1980 as not governing in an overseas context where it could affect \"foreign and military affairs for which the President has unique responsibility\").

Prosecutors are generally barred from participating in matters implicating their personal interests, see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 45.2, and are instructed not to be influenced by their \"own professional or personal circumstances,\" Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.260, so prosecutors would not frequently be in a position to take action that could be perceived as corrupt and personally motivated. And if such cases arise, criminal investigation would be conducted by responsible officials at the Department of Justice, who can be presumed to refrain from pursuing an investigation absent a credible factual basis. Those facts distinguish the criminal context from the common-law rule of prosecutorial immunity, which protects against the threat of suit by \"a defendant [who] often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions.\" Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409,425 (1976). As the Supreme Court has noted, the existence of civil immunity does not justify criminal immunity. See O\u0027Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) (\"Whatever may be the case with respect to civil liability generally, ... we have never held that the performance of the duties of judicial, legislative, or executive officers, requires or contemplates the immunization of otherwise criminal deprivation of constitutional rights.\") (citations omitted). 179 \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 4}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Imbler", "label": "Imbler", "shape": "dot", "title": "Imbler", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Pachtman", "label": "Pachtman", "shape": "dot", "title": "Pachtman", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "O\u0027Shea", "label": "O\u0027Shea", "shape": "dot", "title": "O\u0027Shea", "value": 1}, {"color": "Blue", "id": "Littleton", "label": "Littleton", "shape": "dot", "title": "Littleton", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "May Cer", "label": "May Cer", "shape": "dot", "title": "May Cer", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Lee", "label": "Lee", "shape": "dot", "title": "Lee", "value": 1}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Matertttl", "label": "Matertttl", "shape": "dot", "title": "Matertttl", "value": 1}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_812", "label": "par_812", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Atteme~\u00b7 Weft\u003c Preettet // May Cet\u0027ttaiH Material Prnteetee UHeer Fee.
