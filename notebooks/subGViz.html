On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House that Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBT. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James Corney in which he asked for Corney\u0027s loyalty. On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Corney in which he said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\" Evidence 1. Incoming National Security Advisor Flynn Discusses Sanctions on Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak Shortly after the election, President-Elect Trump announced he would appoint Michael Flynn as his National Security Advisor.78 For the next two months, Flynn played an active role on the Presidential Transition Team (PTT) coordinating policy positions and communicating with foreign government officials, including Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.79 On December 29, 2016, as noted in Volume II, Section TT.A.4, supra, the Obama Administration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian individuals and entities.80 That day, multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the sanctions and the impact they would have on the incoming Administration, and Flynn informed members of the PTT that he would be speaking to the Russian Ambassador later in the day.81 78 Flynn 11/16/17 302, at 7; President-Elect Donald.I Trump Selects US.

R. Criffi. P. 6(e) after being sworn in.495 Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians \u0026 Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.\"496 The President also tweeted, \"James Corney better hope that there are no \u0027tapes\u0027 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\" and \"When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?\"497 Analysis In analyzing the President\u0027s decision to fire Corney, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. The act of firing Corney removed the individual overseeing the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation. The President knew that Corney was personally involved in the investigation based on Corney\u0027s briefing of the Gang of Eight, Corney\u0027s March 20, 2017 public testimony about the investigation, and the President\u0027s one-on-one conversations with Corney. Firing Corney would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect of interfering with or impeding the investigation-for example, if the termination would have the effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity to appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President perceived as more protective of his personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that issue include whether the President\u0027s actions had the potential to discourage a successor director or other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The President fired Corney abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, and criticized him publicly, calling him a \"showboat\" and claiming that the FBI was \"in turmoil\" under his leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were highly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Corney, the President referred to the investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and asked, \"when does it end?\" Those actions had the potential to affect a successor director\u0027s conduct of the investigation. The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director. Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but could not fire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Corney was fired that said, \"The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it.\" Tn addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Corney that the action might prolong the investigation.

Sampson, 898 F.3d 287,302 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988) ( collecting cases). \"It is well established that a[ n] [obstruction-of-justice] offense is complete when one corruptly endeavors to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice; the prosecution need not prove that the due administration of justice was actually obstructed or impeded.\" United States v.

Investigative and Evidentiary Considerations After the appointment of the Special Counsel, this Office obtained evidence about the following events relating to potential issues of obstruction of justice involving the President: (a) The President\u0027s January 27, 2017 dinner with former FBI Director James Corney in which the President reportedly asked for Corney\u0027s loyalty, one day after the White House had been briefed by the Department of Justice on contacts between former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador; (b) The President\u0027s February 14, 2017 meeting with Corney in which the President reportedly asked Corney not to pursue an investigation of Flynn; (c) The President\u0027s private requests to Corney to make public the fact that the President was not the subject of an FBI investigation and to lift what the President regarded as a cloud; (d) The President\u0027s outreach to the Director of National Intelligence and the Directors of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency about the FBI\u0027s Russia investigation; (e) The President\u0027s stated rationales for terminating Corney on May 9, 2017, including statements that could reasonably be understood as acknowledging that the FBT\u0027s Russia investigation was a factor in Corney\u0027s termination; and (f) The President\u0027s reported involvement in issuing a statement about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russians and senior Trump Campaign officials that said the meeting was about adoption and omitted that the Russians had offered to provide the Trump Campaign with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.

A declassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day. Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees-the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)-announced that they would conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the election. Then-FBI Director James Corney later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI\u0027s investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Corney stated: I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\u0027s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u0027s efforts .... As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. The investigation continued under then-Director Corney for the next seven weeks until May 9, 2017, when President Trump fired Corney as FBI Director-an action which is analyzed in Volume II of the rep01t. On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Corney had confirmed in his congressional testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any \u003c/a\u003e", "value": 8}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Clinton", "label": "Clinton", "shape": "dot", "title": "Clinton", "value": 97}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Trump", "label": "Trump", "shape": "dot", "title": "Trump", "value": 131}, {"color": "Red", "id": "Rod Rosenstein", "label": "Rod Rosenstein", "shape": "dot", "title": "Rod Rosenstein", "value": 5}, {"color": "Black", "id": "emails", "label": "emails", "shape": "dot", "title": "emails", "value": 97}, {"color": "grey", "id": "par_648", "label": "par_648", "shape": "dot", "title": "\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\"Line 1\u0026#5;Line 2\u0026#5;Line 3\"\u003e U.S. Department of Justice Aaerfle:,\u00b7 Wark Pretittet // Mu:,\u00b7 Cafltttifl: Muterittl Pt1ateeteti Ufl:tier Feti. R. Ct1im. P. 6(e) 2. Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered by his Recusal Later in 2017, the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who would not be recused. On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the Department of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the Department should be investigating.752 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who was at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton\u0027s emails and said, \"Don\u0027t have to tell us, just take [a] look.\"753 Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the Department of Justice would comply with that request. 754 Two days later, on October 18, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Wow, FBI confirms report that James Corney drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Corney stated under oath that he didn\u0027t do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?\"755 On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was \"ANGER \u0026 UNITY\" over a \"lack of investigation\" of Clinton arid \"the Corney fix,\" and concluded: \"DO SOMETHTNG!\"756 On December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end of a cabinet meeting.757 During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President again suggested that Sessions could \"unrecuse,\" which Porter linked to taking back supervision of the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton.758 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said, \"T don\u0027t know if you could un-recuse yourself. You\u0027d be a hero. Not telling you to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get involved. Can order AG to investigate. I don\u0027t want to get involved. I\u0027m not going to get involved.

P. 6(e) the President.445 Dhillon made a final pitch to the President that Corney should be permitted to resign, but the President refused.446 Around the time the President\u0027s letter was finalized, Priebus summoned Spicer and the press team to the Oval Office, where they were told that Corney had been terminated for the reasons stated in the letters by Rosenstein and Sessions.447 To announce Corney\u0027s termination, the White House released a statement, which Priebus thought had been dictated by the President.448 In full, the statement read: \"Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Corney that he has been terminated and removed from office. President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\"449 That evening, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was summoned to meet with the President at the White House.450 The President told McCabe that he had fired Corney because of the decisions Corney had made in the Clinton email investigation and for many other reasons.451 The President asked McCabe if he was aware that Corney had told the President three times that he was not under investigation.452 The President also asked McCabe whether many people in the FBI disliked Corney and whether McCabe was part of the \"resistance\" that had disagreed with Corney\u0027s decisions in the Clinton investigation.453 McCabe told the President that he knew Corney had told the President he was not under investigation, that most people in the FBI felt positively about Corney, and that McCabe worked \"very closely\" with Corney and was part of all the decisions that had been made in the Clinton investigation.454 445 Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 10; Eisenberg 11/29/17 302, at 15 (providing the view that the President\u0027s desire to include the language about not being under investigation was the \"driving animus of the whole thing\"); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 16 (Burnham knew the only line the President cared about was the line that said Corney advised the President on three separate occasions that the President was not under investigation). According to Hunt\u0027s notes, the reference to Corney\u0027s statement would indicate that \"notwithstanding\" Corney\u0027s having informed the President that he was not under investigation, the President was terminating Corney.

He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u0027s taken off. ... I\u0027m not under investigation.\"469 The President never denied making those statements, and the White House did not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: \"By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia\u0027s actions, James Corney created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified information.\"470 Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with Lavrov, he did not look concerned and said of Corney, \"he is crazy.\"471 When McGahn asked the President about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Corney was fired because that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he could get more work done.472 That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe.473 According to a memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to 467 See, e.g., Sarah Sanders, White House Daily Briefing, C-SPAN (May 10, 2017); SCR013_001088 (5/10/17 Email, Hemming to Cheung et al.)

Accordingly, the President accepted the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Corney from his position.\"479 In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to review Corney\u0027s performance and that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to come to the President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Corney. When a reporter indicated that the \"vast majority\" of FBI agents supported Corney, Sanders said, \"Look, we\u0027ve heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.\"48\u00b0 Following the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments.481 Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from \"countless members of the FBI\" was a \"slip of the tongue.\"482 She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Corney was a comment she made \"in the heat of the moment\" that was not founded on anything.483 Also on May I 0, 2017, Sessions and Rosenstein each spoke to McGahn and expressed concern that the White House was creating a narrative that Rosenstein had initiated the decision to 474 McCabe 5/10/l 7 Memorandum, at 1. 475 McCabe 5/ I 0/17 Memorandum, at I. 476 McCabe 5/10/17 Memorandum, at I; Rybicki 6/13/17 302, at 2.
