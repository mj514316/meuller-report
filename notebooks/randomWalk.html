According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. congressman that the DNC hack was an \"inside job,\" and purported to have \"physical proof\u0027 that Russians did not give materials to Assange. 182 C. Additional GRU Cyber Operations While releasing the stolen emails and documents through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and WikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hack victims linked to the Democratic campaign and, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in several states. 1. Summer and Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims On July 27 2016, Unit 26165 targeted email accounts connected to candidate Clinton\u0027s personal office . Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that included the following: \"Russia, if you\u0027re listening, I hope you\u0027re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\"183 The \"30,000 emails\" were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored on a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State. Within approximately five hours of Trump\u0027s statement, GRU officers targeted for the first time Clinton\u0027s personal office. After candidate Trump\u0027s remarks, Unit 26165 created and sent malicious links targeting 15 email accounts at the domain including an email account belonging to Clinton aide The investigation did not find evidence of earlier GRU attempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain. It is unclear how the GRU was able to identify these email accounts, which were not public.184 Unit 26165 officers also hacked into a DNC account hosted on a cloud-computing service copies of the DNC da databases (referred to On September 20, 2016, the GRU began to generate function designed to allow users to produce backups of as \"snapshots\").
