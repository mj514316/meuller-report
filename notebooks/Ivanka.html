Trump, the Trump Organization agreed to accept an arrangement whereby the organization received a flat 3.5% commission on all sales, with no licensing fees or incentives.295 The parties negotiated a letter of intent during January and February 2014.296 From January 2014 through November 2014, the Trump Organization and Crocus Group discussed development plans for the Moscow project. Some time before January 24, 2014, the Crocus Group sent the Trump Organization a proposal for a 800-unit, 194-meter building to be \u00b7 constructed at an Agalarov-owned site in Moscow called \"Crocus City,\" which had also been the site of the Miss Universe pageant.297 In February 2014, Ivanka Trump met with Emin Agalarov and toured the Crocus City site during a visit to Moscow.298 From March 2014 through July 2014, the groups discussed \"design standards\" and other architectural elements.299 For example, in July 2014, members of the Trump Organization sent Crocus Group counterparties questions about the \"demographics of these prospective buyers\" in the Crocus City area, the development of neighboring parcels in Crocus City, and concepts for redesigning portions of the building.300 In August 2014, the Trump Organization requested specifications for a competing Marriott-branded tower being built in Crocus City.301 Beginning in September 2014, the Trump Organization stopped responding in a timely fashion to correspondence and proposals from the Crocus Group.302 Communications between the two groups continued through November 2014 with decreasing frequency; what appears to be the last communication is dated November 24, 2014.303 The project appears not to have developed past the planning stage, and no construction occurred. 294 295 OSC-KA V _00452 (12/23/13 Email, Trmnp Jr. to Kaveladze \u0026 E.

The President Directs Communications Staff Not to Publicly Disclose Information About the June 9 Meeting Communications advisors Hope Hicks and Josh Raffel recalled discussing with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump that the emails were damaging and would inevitably be leaked.675 Hicks and Raffel advised that the best strategy was to proactively release the emails to the press.676 On or about June 22, 2017, Hicks attended a meeting in the White House residence with the President, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump.677 According to Hicks, Kushner said that he wanted to fill the President in on something that had been discovered in the documents he was to provide to the congressional committees involving a meeting with him, Manafort, and Trump Jr.678 Kushner brought a folder of documents to the meeting and tried to show them to the President, but the President stopped Kushner and said he did not want to know about it, shutting the conversation down.679 On June 28, 2017, Hicks viewed the emails at Kushner\u0027s attorney\u0027s office.680 She recalled being shocked by the emails because they looked \"really bad.\"681 The next day, Hicks spoke privately with the President to mention her concern about the emails, which she understood were soon going to be shared with Congress.682 The President seemed upset because too many people knew about the emails and he told Hicks that just one lawyer should deal with the matter.683 The President indicated that he did not think the emails would leak, but said they would leak if everyone had access to them.684 673 Priebus 4/3/18 302, at 7. 674 Corallo 2/ 15/ 18 3 02, at 3; Hicks 12/7/ 17 302, at 8; Raffel 2/8/ l 8 302, at 3. 675 Raffel 2/8/18 302, at 2-3; Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 2. 676 Raffel 2/8/18 302, at 2-3, 5; Hicks 3/13/ l 8 302, at 2; Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 8. 677 Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 6-7; Hicks 3/13/18 302, at I. 678 Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 7; Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 1. 679 Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 7; Hicks 3/13/18 302, at I.

According to Gates, Manafort warned the group that the meeting likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful.705 Hicks denied any knowledge of the June 9 meeting before 2017,706 and Kushner did not recall if the planned June 9 meeting came up at all earlier that week.707 Michael Cohen recalled being in Donald J. Trump\u0027s office on June 6 or 7 when Trump Jr. told his father that a meeting to obtain adverse information about Clinton was going forward.708 Cohen did not recall Trump Jr. stating that the meeting was connected to Russia.709 From the tenor of the conversation, Cohen believed that Trump Jr. had previously discussed the meeting with his father, although Cohen was not involved in any such conversation.710 In an interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, Trump Jr. stated that he did not inform his father about the 699 NOSC0000007-08 (6/8/18 Email, Kushner to Vargas). 700 NOSC00000039-42 (6/8/16 Email, Trump Jr. to Kushner \u0026 Manafort); DJTJR00485 (6/8/16 Email, Trump Jr. to Kushner \u0026 Manafort). 701 NOSC0000004 (6/8/16 Email, Kushner to Vargas). 702 6/8/16 Email, Manafo1t to Trump Jr. 703 Gates 1/30/18 302, at 7; Gates 3/1/18 302, at 3-4.

Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen.335 He told the Office that, after receiving this inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov\u0027s name and concluded (incorrectly) that Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter.336 Between November 18 and 19, 2015,-Klokov and Cohen had at least one telephone call and exchanged several emails. Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a \"trusted person\" who could offer the Campaign \"political synergy\" and \"synergy on a government level,\" Klokov recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary. Klokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the candidate and an individual Klokov described as \"our person of interest.\"337 In an email to the Office, Erchova later identified the \"person of interest\" as Russian President Vladimir Putin. 338 In the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local developers. Cohen registered his willingness also to meet with Klokov and the unidentified intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate including a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin-would need to be \"in conjunction with the development and an official visit\" with the Trump Organization receiving a formal invitation to visit.339 (Klokov had written previously that \"the visit [by candidate Trump to Russia] has to be informal.\")340 Klokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over a possible meeting between Trump and \"the person of interest\" from any existing business track. 341 Re-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second email to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have \"phenomenal\" impact \"in a business dimension\" and that the \"person of interest[\u0027s]\" \"most important support\" could have significant ramifications for the \"level of projects and their capacity.\" Klokov concluded by telling 335 11/16/15 Email, I.
