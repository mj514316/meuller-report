On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be interviewed by FBI agents, who informed him that the interview was part of the investigation into potential Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election. During the interview, Papadopoulos lied about the timing, extent, and nature of his communications with Joseph Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya, and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to timing, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians had \"dirt\" on Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails.\" But Papadopoulos stated multiple times that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campaign and that it was a \"very strange coincidence\" to be told of the \"dirt\" before he started working for the Campaign. This account was false. Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March 14, 2016, after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the Campaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos only after learning of his role on the Campaign. And Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on candidate Clinton in late April 2016, more than a month after Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and 192 '"

P. 6(e) 2016 to early October 2016.394 In late April 2016, Papadopoulos was told by London-based professor Joseph Mifsud, immediately after Mifsud\\'s return from a trip to Moscow, that the Russian government had obtained \"dirt\" on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. One week later, on May 6, 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to candidate Clinton. Papadopoulos shared information about Russian \"dirt\" with people outside of the Campaign, and the Office investigated whether he also provided it to a Campaign official. Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom he interacted told the Office that they did · not recall that Papadopoulos passed them the information. Throughout the relevant period of time and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. That meeting never came to pass. a. Origins of Campaign Work In March 2016, Papadopoulos became a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.395 As early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign but, in a September 30, 2015 email, he was told that the Campaign was not hiring policy advisors.396 In late 2015, Papadopoulos obtained a paid position on the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. 397 Although Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 20 I 6, Papadopoulos had stopped actively working for his campaign by early February 2016.398 At that time, Papadopoulos reached out to a contact at the London Centre of International Law Practice (LCILP), which billed itself as a \"unique institution . . .

       "      <td>statements about the results of our investigation and the Special Counsel's charging decisions, and we then provide an overview of the two volumes of our report. The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel's Office found to be supp01ted by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts. In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[ e ]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign \"coordinat[ ed]\"-a term that appears in the appointment order-with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement-tacit or express-between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. * * *</td>\n",

The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law-including foreign-fnfluence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed further below.

P. 6(e) after being sworn in.495 Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians &amp; Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.\"496 The President also tweeted, \"James Corney better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\" and \"When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?\"497 Analysis In analyzing the President's decision to fire Corney, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. The act of firing Corney removed the individual overseeing the FBI's Russia investigation. The President knew that Corney was personally involved in the investigation based on Corney's briefing of the Gang of Eight, Corney's March 20, 2017 public testimony about the investigation, and the President's one-on-one conversations with Corney. Firing Corney would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect of interfering with or impeding the investigation-for example, if the termination would have the effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity to appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President perceived as more protective of his personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that issue include whether the President's actions had the potential to discourage a successor director or other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The President fired Corney abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, and criticized him publicly, calling him a \"showboat\" and claiming that the FBI was \"in turmoil\" under his leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were highly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Corney, the President referred to the investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and asked, \"when does it end?\" Those actions had the potential to affect a successor director's conduct of the investigation. The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director. Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but could not fire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Corney was fired that said, \"The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it.\" Tn addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Corney that the action might prolong the investigation.

Russian Government Outreach and Contacts As explained in Section IV above, the Office's investigation uncovered evidence of numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above-with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine. One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on Hillary Clinton-implicates an additional body of law: campaignfinance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As ex lained below, the Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russiaaffiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct the Office's investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice. 1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of \"collusion,\" but through the lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[ e ]\" appears in the Acting Attorney General's August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371. See Black's Law Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is \"[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law\"); 1 Alexander Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) (\"An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.\"); 1 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 352 180</td>\n",

He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion-a Hoax!\"864 Later in the day, the President tweeted, \"Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and 'Public Enemy Number One,' or Paul Manafort, political operative &amp; Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement-although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?\"865 The President's tweets about the Manafort trial were widely covered by the press.866 When asked about the President's tweets, Sanders told the press, \"Certainly, the President's been clear. He thinks Paul Manafort's been treated unfairly.\"867 On August 16, 2018, the Manafort case was submitted to the jury and deliberations began. At that time, Giuliani had recently suggested to reporters that the Special Counsel investigation needed to be \"done in the next two or three weeks,\"868 and media stories reported that a Manafort acquittal would add to criticism that the Special Counsel investigation was not worth the time and expense, whereas a conviction could show that ending the investigation would be premature.869 861 State of the Union with Jake Tapper Transcript, CNN (June 17, 2018). 862 See, e.g., Katelyn Polantz, Takeaways from day one of the Paul Manafort trial, CNN (July 31, 2018); Frank Bruni, Paul Manafort 's Trial Is Donald Trump's, Too, New York Times Opinion (July 31, 2018); Rachel Weiner et al., Paul Manafort trial Day 2: Witnesses describe extravagant clothing purchases, home remodels, lavish cars paid with wire transfers, Washington Post (Aug. 1, 2018). 863 @realDonaldTrump 8/1/18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet.

The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel's Office found to be supp01ted by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts. In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[ e ]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign \"coordinat[ ed]\"-a term that appears in the appointment order-with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement-tacit or express-between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. * * *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

P. 6(e) (1897) (\"An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.\"). For that reason, this Office's focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term \"collusion.\" The Office considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy-either under statutes that have their own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1349, 195l(a)), or under the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. § 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume I, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal criminal law-including foreign-fnfluence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either under a specific statute or under Section 371 's offenses clause. The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under Section 371 's defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a lawful function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Obstructive act. To determine if the President's effo11s to have the Attorney General unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia investigation.

P. 6(e) after being sworn in.495 Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, \"Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.\"496 The President also tweeted, \"James Corney better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\" and \"When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?\"497 Analysis In analyzing the President's decision to fire Corney, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: a. Obstructive act. The act of firing Corney removed the individual overseeing the FBI's Russia investigation. The President knew that Corney was personally involved in the investigation based on Corney's briefing of the Gang of Eight, Corney's March 20, 2017 public testimony about the investigation, and the President's one-on-one conversations with Corney. Firing Corney would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect of interfering with or impeding the investigation-for example, if the termination would have the effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity to appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President perceived as more protective of his personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that issue include whether the President's actions had the potential to discourage a successor director or other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The President fired Corney abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, and criticized him publicly, calling him a \"showboat\" and claiming that the FBI was \"in turmoil\" under his leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were highly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Corney, the President referred to the investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and asked, \"when does it end?\" Those actions had the potential to affect a successor director's conduct of the investigation. The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director. Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but could not fire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Corney was fired that said, \"The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it.\" Tn addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Corney that the action might prolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to serve as interim director, e                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Russian Government Outreach and Contacts As explained in Section IV above, the Office's investigation uncovered evidence of numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above-with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine. One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising derogatory information on Hillary Clinton-implicates an additional body of law: campaignfinance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As ex lained below, the Office evaluated those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law. Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russiaaffiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct the Office's investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice. 1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of \"collusion,\" but through the lens of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[ e ]\" appears in the Acting Attorney General's August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371. See Black's Law Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is \"[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law\"); 1 Alexander Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) (\"An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.\"); 1 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 352 180                                                                                        \n",

He thinks Paul Manafort's been treated unfairly.\"867 On August 16, 2018, the Manafort case was submitted to the jury and deliberations began. At that time, Giuliani had recently suggested to reporters that the Special Counsel investigation needed to be \"done in the next two or three weeks,\"868 and media stories reported that a Manafort acquittal would add to criticism that the Special Counsel investigation was not worth the time and expense, whereas a conviction could show that ending the investigation would be premature.869 861 State of the Union with Jake Tapper Transcript, CNN (June 17, 2018). 862 See, e.g., Katelyn Polantz, Takeaways from day one of the Paul Manafort trial, CNN (July 31, 2018); Frank Bruni, Paul Manafort 's Trial Is Donald Trump's, Too, New York Times Opinion (July 31, 2018); Rachel Weiner et al., Paul Manafort trial Day 2: Witnesses describe extravagant clothing purchases, home remodels, lavish cars paid with wire transfers, Washington Post (Aug. 1, 2018). 863 @realDonaldTrump 8/1/18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet.
